They travel to California, suffering the misfortunes of the homeless in the Great Depression.","The film opens with Tom Joad (Henry Fonda), released from prison and hitchhiking his way back to his parents' family farm in Oklahoma. Tom finds an itinerant ex-preacher named Jim Casy (John Carradine) sitting under a tree by the side of the road. Casy was the preacher who baptized Tom, but now Casy has ""lost the spirit"" and his faith (presaging his imminent conversion to communism). Casy goes with Tom to the Joad property only to find it deserted. There, they meet Muley Graves (John Qualen) who is hiding out. In a flashback, he describes how farmers all over the area were forced from their farms by the deed holders of the land. A local boy (Irving Bacon), hired for the purpose, is shown knocking down Muley's house with a Caterpillar tractor. Following this, Tom and Casy move on to find the Joad family at Tom's Uncle John's place. His family is happy to see Tom and explain they have made plans to head for California in search of employment, as their farm has been foreclosed on by the bank. The large Joad family of twelve leaves at daybreak, along with Casy who decides to accompany them. They pack everything into a dilapidated 1926 Hudson ""Super Six"" sedan adapted to serve as a truck in order to make the long journey to the promised land of California.\r\rThe trip along Highway 66 is arduous, and it soon takes a toll on the Joad family. The elderly Grandpa (Charley Grapewin) dies along the way. Tom writes the circumstances surrounding the death on a page from the family Bible and places it on the body before they bury it so that if his remains were found, his death would not be investigated as a possible homicide. They park in a camp and meet a man, a migrant returning from California, who laughs at Pa's optimism about conditions in California. He speaks bitterly about his experiences in the West.\r\rThe family arrives at the first transient migrant campground for workers and finds the camp is crowded with other starving, jobless and desperate travelers. Their truck slowly makes its way through the dirt road between the shanty houses and around the camp's hungry-faced inhabitants. Tom says, ""Sure don't look none too prosperous.""\r\rAfter some trouble with a so-called ""agitator"", the Joads leave the camp in a hurry. The Joads make their way to another migrant camp, the Keene Ranch. After doing some work in the fields, they discover the high food prices in the company store for meat and other products. The store is the only one in the area, by a long shot. Later they find a group of migrant workers are striking, and Tom wants to find out all about it. He goes to a secret meeting in the dark woods. When the meeting is discovered, Casy is killed by one of the camp guards. As Tom tries to defend Casy from the attack, he inadvertently kills the guard.\r\rTom suffers a serious wound on his cheek, and the camp guards realize it will not be difficult to identify him. That evening the family hides Tom under the mattresses of the truck just as guards arrive to question them; they are searching for the man who killed the guard. Tom avoids being spotted and the family leaves the Keene Ranch without further incident. After driving for a while, they have to stop at the top of a hill when the engine overheats due to a broken fan belt; they have little gas, but decide to try coasting down the hill to some lights. The lights are from a third type of camp: Farmworkers' Wheat Patch Camp (Weedpatch in the book), a clean camp run by the Department of Agriculture, complete with indoor toilets and showers, which the Joad children had never seen before.\r\rTom is moved to work for change by what he has witnessed in the various camps. He tells his family that he plans to carry on Casy's mission in the world by fighting for social reform. He leaves to seek a new world and to join the movement committed to social justice.\r\rTom Joad says:\r\rI'll be all around in the dark. I'll be everywhere. Wherever you can look, wherever there's a fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad. I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry and they know supper's ready, and when the people are eatin' the stuff they raise and livin' in the houses they build, I'll be there, too.\r\rAs the family moves on again, they discuss the fear and difficulties they have had. Ma Joad concludes the film, saying:\r\rI ain't never gonna be scared no more. I was, though. For a while it looked as though we was beat. Good and beat. Looked like we didn't have nobody in the whole wide world but enemies. Like nobody was friendly no more. Made me feel kinda bad and scared too, like we was lost and nobody cared.... Rich fellas come up and they die, and their kids ain't no good and they die out, but we keep a-coming. We're the people that live. They can't wipe us out, they can't lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa, cos we're the people.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzgzNjcxNjg2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQxNDQ3Mg@@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg",0.838424644,21,23,,98,NOT RATED,1222,8.2,54706,3/15/40,0,"129,West Germany:108",cut version,129 min,0,0,0,The Grapes of Wrath,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grapes_of_Wrath_(film),"Nunnally Johnson (screen play), John Steinbeck (based on the novel by)",1940

The school officials tell Mary she can only stay on if she works for the school, to pay her tuition.\r\rMary decides to leave school to find her sister. She returns to New York City, and finds that her sister had sold her cosmetics business eight months earlier. She locates the apartment Jacqueline was renting, and finds only a chair and a noose hanging from the ceiling in the otherwise bare apartment. This only makes Mary more anxious and determined to find her.\r\rHer investigation leads her to Jacqueline's secret husband Gregory Ward (Hugh Beaumont), a failed poet (Erford Gage), and a mysterious psychiatrist, Dr. Judd (Tom Conway). Jacqueline had been Judd's patient, seeking treatment for depression stemming from her membership in a Satanic cult called the Palladists. She was seduced into joining the cult by her former co-workers. Mary enlists a private detective (Lou Lubin) to help in her investigation, but he is stabbed to death under mysterious circumstances. Judd helps her locate Jacqueline, who is hiding from the cult. Ward falls in love with Mary. Jacqueline is kidnapped by the cult members and condemned to death, because their rules state that anyone who reveals the cult must die. She would be the seventh person condemned under these rules since the founding of the cult (hence the film's title).\r\rThe cult has rules against violence, and decides that Jacqueline, who is suicidal, should kill herself. When she refuses, the cult members let her leave, but send an assassin to follow her. She eludes him and returns to Mary's apartment, which is next to her own. She briefly encounters her neighbor (Elizabeth Russell), a young woman with a terminal illness. The neighbor says sheäó»s afraid to die, but she is tired of being afraid and plans a last night out on the town. Jacqueline enters her own apartment and hangs herself. The thud of the chair falling over is heard, but the sick woman does not recognize the sound as she leaves for the evening.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmY1OWFlZDgtOWFmOS00YTBlLWI0ZTUtYmRmOTUyNmFjY2EyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUxODE0MDY@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.406008113,,,,,APPROVED,12100,7,3324,8/21/43,0,71,,71 min,0,0,0,The Seventh Victim,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seventh_Victim,"Charles O'Neal, DeWitt Bodeen",1943

But his tyrannical behavior along the way causes a mutiny, led by his adopted son.","Thomas Dunson (John Wayne) is a stubborn man who wants nothing more than to start up a successful cattle ranch in Texas. Shortly after he begins his journey to Texas with his trail hand, Nadine Groot (Walter Brennan), Dunson learns that his love interest (Coleen Gray), whom he had told to stay behind with the wagon train with the understanding that he would send for her later, was killed in an Indian attack. Despite this tragedy, Dunson and Groot press on. That night, Dunson and Groot, keeping watch, hear a group of Indians planning to attack them. They kill the Indians, and on the wrist of one, Dunson finds a bracelet he had been left by his late mother. One day before, he had presented it to his young love as he left the wagon train. The bracelet reappears significantly later in the film.\r\rThe next day, an orphaned boy named Matthew Garth (played as a boy by Mickey Kuhn and as an adult by Montgomery Clift) who had been part of the wagon train Dunson had left, and who came back from finding a strayed cow to see the ruins of the train wanders into Dunson and Groot's camp, traumatized and babbling incoherently. He was the sole survivor of the wagon train. Dunson adopts him and ties the boy's cow to his wagon, alongside a bull Dunson already owned.\r\rWith only the bull and the cow, Dunson, Groot and the boy enter Texas by crossing the Red River. In search for land they traveled through Texas, finally deciding to settle in deep South Texas near the Rio Grande. Upon arrival, Dunson proudly proclaims all the land about them as his own. Two Mexican men appear on horseback and inform Dunson that the land already belongs to their boss. Dunson dismisses this inconvenient fact and thanks to a quicker draw in a showdown, kills one of the men and tells the other man to inform his boss that Dunson now owns the land. Dunson names his new spread the Red River D, after his chosen cattle brand for his herd. Fatefully, he promises to add M (for Matt) to the brand, once Matt has earned it.\r\r14 years pass and Dunson now has a fully operational cattle ranch. With the help of Matt and Groot, his herd now numbers over ten thousand cattle, but he is also broke as a result of widespread poverty in the southern United States. Due to its loss of the American Civil War, the South cannot afford Dunson's beef. Dunson decides to drive his massive herd hundreds of miles north to the railhead at Sedalia, Missouri, where he believes they will fetch a good price.\r\rAfter Dunson hires some extra men to help out with the drive, including professional gunman Cherry Valance (John Ireland), the perilous northward drive starts. Along the way, they encounter many troubles, including a stampede, sparked by one of the men making a clatter while trying to steal sugar from the chuck wagon, that leads to the death of Dan Latimer (Harry Carey Jr). En route, they are told by casually met strangers that the railroad line has reached Abilene, Kansas, much closer than Sedalia. When Dunson establishes that none of these wayfarers have seen the railroad, he disregards the news in favor of plugging on to Missouri.\r\rDeeper problems arise when Dunson's tyrannical leadership style begins to affect the rest of the men. One of the two chuck wagons accompanying the drive had been destroyed in the stampede, morale drops because the men are living on nothing but beef, and have no coffee to drink. Dunson by now is broke and cannot buy more supplies. When he attempts to lynch two men who had deserted the drive and taken a sack of flour and 100 rounds with them, Matt rebels. With the help of Valance and the other men, Matt takes control of the drive in order to take it to the hoped-for closer railhead in Abilene, Kansas. Face to face, Dunson curses him and threatens to kill him when next they meet. The drive resumes toward Abilene, leaving the lightly injured Dunson behind with his horse and a few supplies. Matt and his men are well aware that Dunson will try to recruit a posse to pursue and attack them.\r\rOn the way to Abilene, Matt and his men repulse an Indian attack on a wagon train. One of the people they save is Tess Millay (Joanne Dru), who falls in love with Matt. They spend a night together and he gives her Dunson's mother's bracelet, evidently given to him in earlier years. Eager to outpace Dunson to Abilene, he leaves early in the morningäóîas Dunson had left the original wagon train 14 years earlier.\r\rLater Tess encounters Dunson, who has followed Matt's trail to the new wagon train. He sees that she wears his mother's bracelet. Weary and emotional, he tells Tess what he wants most of all is a son. She offers to bear him one if he abandons his hunt. Dunson sees in her the same anguish that his beloved had expressed when he left her at the original doomed wagon train. Regardless of that, he resumes his hunt. The bracelet has moved from one sweetheart to another.\r\rWhen Matt reaches Abilene, he finds the town has been eagerly awaiting the arrival of such a herd to buy it and ship it east by rail. Unknowingly, he has completed the first cattle drive along what would become known as the Chisholm Trail. He accepts an excellent offer for the cattle. Shortly thereafter, Dunson arrives in Abilene with a posse to follow through with his vow to kill Matt. Cherry Valance tries to keep the two apart. Dunson shoots him and Valance inflicts a flesh wound on Dunson. Dunson and Matt begin a furious fight, which Tess interrupts by drawing a gun on both men, shooting wildly, and demanding that they realize the love that they share. Dunson and Matt see the error of their ways and make peace. In earlier days, both men had laid their inner hearts open to her. The film ends with Dunson telling Matt that he will incorporate an M into the brand as he had promised 14 years before, and advises Matt to marry Tess.\r\rNote: In Chase's original Saturday Evening Post story, Valance shoots Dunson dead in Abilene and Matt takes his body back to Texas to be buried on his ranch.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NDA3NTQ2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODUzNzU2NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.481752167,,,,,APPROVED,1211,7.8,19357,9/17/48,1,"133,West Germany:92,USA:126",original theatrical version,133 min,0,0,0,Red River,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_(1948_film),"Borden Chase (screenplay), Charles Schnee (screenplay), Borden Chase (from ""The Saturday Evening Post"" story)",1948

A humanoid(Michael Rennie) emerges, announcing that he has come in peace. When he advances, however, he unexpectedly opens a small cylindrical device and is shot by a nervous soldier. A tall robot emerges from the saucer and disintegrates all of the soldiers' weapons using an energy ray. The alien orders Gort, the robot, to stop, then explains that the now-broken device was simply a gift for the President, which would have enabled him ""to study life on the other planets"". The wounded alien is taken to Walter Reed Hospital, where he reveals his name: Klaatu. He uses a salve to quickly heal his wound. Meanwhile, the military attempts to enter the spaceship, but finds it impenetrable; Gort stands outside the ship, silent and unmoving. Klaatu tells the President's secretary, Mr. Harley (Frank Conroy), that he has come with a message that must be revealed to all the world's leaders simultaneously. Harley tells him that such a meeting in the current political climate is impossible. Klaatu suggests that he be allowed to go among humans to better understand their ""unreasoning suspicions and attitudes."" Harley rejects the proposal and leaves Klaatu under guard. Klaatu escapes and lodges at a boarding house as ""Mr. Carpenter"" (the name on the dry cleaner's tag on the suit he ""borrowed""). Among the residents are young widow Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her son Bobby (Billy Gray). The next morning, Klaatu listens to his fellow boarders' speculations about the alien's purpose. While Helen and her boyfriend Tom Stephens (Hugh Marlowe) go out, Klaatu babysits Bobby. The boy takes Klaatu on a tour of the city, including a visit to his father's grave in Arlington National Cemetery; Klaatu learns that most of those buried there were killed in wars. The two visit the Lincoln Memorial, then the heavily guarded space ship. While at theLincoln Memorial, Klaatu asks Bobby who the greatest person living is; Bobby suggests Professor Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe), who lives in the city. Bobby takes Klaatu to Barnhardt's home, but the professor is absent. Klaatu adds a mathematical equation to a problem on Barnhardt's blackboard and leaves his contact information with the suspicious housekeeper. Later, government agents escort Klaatu to see Barnhardt. Klaatu warns the professor that the people of the other planets have become concerned for their safety after humans developed atomic power. Klaatu declares that, if his message goes unheeded, ""Earth will be eliminated."" Barnhardt agrees to gather scientists at Klaatu's saucer, suggesting that Klaatu give a demonstration of his power. Klaatu returns to his spaceship the next evening, unaware that Bobby has followed him. Bobby sees Gort knock out two guards and ""Mr. Carpenter"" enter the spaceship. Bobby tells Helen and Tom what he saw, but they do not believe him until Tom takes a diamond found in Klaatu's room to a jeweller, who informs him it is ""unlike any other on Earth."" Klaatu finds Helen at her workplace. They take an empty service elevator which stops precisely at noon. Klaatu reveals his true identity, and the reason for coming to Earth then asks for her help. He has neutralized all electricity everywhere except where human safety would be compromised, such as hospitals and aircraft in flight. After the blackout ends, the manhunt for Klaatu intensifies. When Tom informs the military of his suspicions, Helen breaks up with him. Helen and Klaatu take a taxi to Barnhardt's home. En route, he tells her that should anything happen to him, she must go to Gort and say these words: ""Klaatu barada nikto"". After being spotted, Klaatu makes a break for it, but is gunned down. Helen then heads to the saucer. Gort awakens, disintegrates the two army night guards, and advances on her. When Helen utters the three words, the robot carries her into the spaceship, then retrieves Klaatu's body from a jail cell. Gort revives Klaatu, but he explains to Helen that this is only temporary, that the power of life and death is ""reserved for the Almighty Spirit"". Klaatu and Helen emerge from the saucer after Barnhardt's scientists have assembled. Klaatu declares that the people of Earth have a choice. They can join the other planets in peace, but should they threaten to extend their violence into space, ""this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder. [...] We will be waiting for your answer"".

Tate assumes that Kemp is a sheriff and Kemp does nothing to disillusion him.\r\rThey trap someone on top of a rocky hill who Kemp is convinced must be his wanted man. Rockslides force a retreat. Looking for a way around the hill, Kemp and Tate meet up with a Union soldier, Lieutenant Roy Anderson (Ralph Meeker). He has been discharged from the 6th Cavalry at Fort Ellis in Bozeman and is heading east. Tate questions why Anderson isn't on the Bozeman Trail. Anderson's story is that there are some ""bad tempered Indians"" whose chief's daughter fell in with a handsome young army lieutenant. Kemp has a chance to see Anderson's discharge order in which he is described as ""morally unstable"" and given a dishonorable discharge.\r\rTate tells Anderson that Kemp is a sheriff. With the aid of Anderson, who scales a sheer cliff face, Vandergroat is caught, along with his companion, Lina Patch (Janet Leigh), the daughter of Vandergroat's friend, Frank Patch, who was shot dead trying to rob a bank in Abilene.\r\r\r \r\r\r James Stewart and Millard Mitchell\rVandergroat sets Tate and Anderson straight on two facts: that Kemp is no lawman, and that a reward is offered to bring him inäóî $5000.00äóîdead or alive. Tate and Anderson want their shares, to aid Kemp in getting Vandergroat back to Kansas. Lina is convinced that her father's friend is innocent.\r\rOn the trail to Abilene, Vandergroat attempts to turn his captors against each other, using greed as his weapon. He also encourages Lina to use her beauty to divide Kemp and Anderson. When scouting a way through a mountain pass, Kemp and Tate spot a dozen Blackfeet, a normally friendly tribe, far from their normal hunting grounds. They tell the others and Anderson confesses that the Indians are after him. Kemp tells Anderson to hightail it out of there to avoid being captured by the Blackfeet. Anderson thinks Kemp just wants a bigger share of the reward money. He rides ahead, and from his position hidden behind a fallen tree trunk, with his rifle he elects to pick off a chief of the Blackfeet, at the moment Kemp's group have confronted the Indians and are about to engage them in talk.\r\r\r \r\r\r Millard Mitchell and James Stewart\rDuring the ensuing battle, Kemp saves Lina from the Blackfeet and she, in turn, helps him when he is shot in the leg. Later, Kemp passes out on the trail and awakes from a delirious nightmare. He thinks Lina is Mary, his ex-fiancí©e. Vandergroat tells the others that Mary sold Kemp's ranch, which he left in her safekeeping, while he was serving in the army during the Civil War, and then went off with another man. Vandergroat further reveals that Kemp is determined to buy his ranch back, and that it can't happen if he splits the reward money with Anderson and Tate.\r\rLina's feelings of loyalty to her father's friend, combined with an attraction to Kemp, confuses her. She has never seen Vandergroat hurt anyone unless it was in a fair fight but after he loosens Kemp's saddle cinch and tries to push him off a high mountain pass, Lina's sympathies for Kemp grow.\r\rTaking refuge from a storm in a cave, Vandergroat manipulates Lina into distracting Kemp. She tells the rancher of her dream to go to California, where no one knows her and she can make a fresh start. He tells her of his wish to repurchase his ranch. They kiss and this gives Ben a chance to escape. Kemp catches Vandergroat, and Anderson suggests that since the reward is for a ""dead or alive"" criminal, they should just kill the troublemaker. Tate stops Anderson but, caught up in the anger of the moment and hurt by what he sees as Lina's treachery, Kemp challenges Vandergroat to a shoot out. The wanted man declines to take part.\r\rNext day, the group comes to a high-running river. They argue about whether to cross or go down stream. Anderson grabs a rope and throws it around Vandergroat's neck and says he'll drag him across the river. A fight ensues between Kemp and Anderson, as Vandergroat watches with malicious enjoyment. Kemp finally manages to kick Anderson unconscious. While Kemp and Anderson recover from the fight and Lina searches for firewood, Vandergroat convinces Tate to sneak off with him to find a gold mine, the whereabouts of which Vandergroat has been tempting the old man with. When they depart during the night, he convinces Tate to take Lina along.\r\r\r \r\r\r James Stewart\rVandergroat and Lina ride double; Tate follows, holding a rifle on them. Ben suddenly yells, ""Snake!"" and in the confusion grabs Tate's rifle from him and kills him. He fires two more shots in order to lure Kemp and Anderson to a spot where he intends to kill them. Lina finally sees Vandergroat for what he is.\r\rKemp and Anderson discover Tate's body where Vandergroat has positioned it for an ambush from the high cliff face. Preparing to shoot Kemp, Vandergroat is caught off guard when Lina grabs the rifle barrel, saving Kemp's life. While Anderson exchanges gunfire with Vandergroat, Kemp removes one of his spurs to aid in climbing up the back of the cliff to outflank Vandergroat. He uses the spur as a combination climbing ax and makeshift piton.\r\rVandergroat, hearing Kemp, gets the drop on the rancher. However, before he can pull the trigger, Kemp throws his spur into the killer's left cheek. As Ben reels from the pain of the spur, he is shot by Anderson and his body falls into the nearby river, becoming entangled in the roots of a tree. Anderson lassos a branch on the other side of the river and crosses using the rope. He then wraps it around Ben's body but is crushed by a large tree stump barrelling down the river.\r\rThe course of the speeding flood helps understate a plot device_the äóìdeus ex machinaäó from upstream, also a way of blindsiding the audience_not the first portrayal of danger from ""upstream"", but perhaps the most obvious instance of the device, up to this moment in American film plots.\r\rKemp grabs the rope and drags Vandergroat's body across the river and, in a rage, vows that he will take him back to reclaim his land. Lina pleads with him not to take blood money for bringing Vandergroat in. She says she will go with him, no matter what, marry him, and live with him on the ranch. Kemp realizes what he is doing and his love for Lina makes him stop. He begins digging a grave to bury Vandergroat and they decide to make for California, leaving their pasts behind.\r",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNTI3MzY0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg0MDgyMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.828537566,,,,,PASSED,12310,7.5,7055,6/26/53,0,91,,91 min,0,0,1,The Naked Spur,movie,0,1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Naked_Spur,"Sam Rolfe, Harold Jack Bloom",1953

It revolves around two peasant couples äóñ Genjur_ and Miyagi, T_bei and Ohama äóñ who are uprooted as Shibata Katsuie's army sweeps through their farming village, Nakanog_. Genjur_, a potter, takes his wares to nearby _mizo. He is accompanied by T_bei, who dreams of becoming a samurai. A respected sage tells Miyagi to warn her husband about seeking profit in time of upheaval, and to prepare for a probable attack on the village. Genjur_ arrives with his profits, but she asks him to stop. Genjur_ nevertheless works long hours to finish his pottery. That night Nakanog_ is attacked by soldiers, and the four main characters hide out in the woods.\r\rGenjur_ decides to take the pots to a different marketplace, and the two couples travel across a lake. Out of the thick fog another boat appears. The sole passenger tells them he was attacked by pirates, warns them back to their homes, then dies. The two men decide to return their wives to the shore. T_bei's wife refuses to go; Miyagi begs Genjur_ not to leave her, but is left on the shore with their young son, Gen'ichi, clasped to her back. At market, Genjur_'s pottery sells well. After taking his promised share of the profits, T_bei runs off to buy samurai armor, and sneaks into the ranks of a clan of samurai. Lost from her companions, Ohama has wandered beyond Nagahama in her desperate search for T_bei. She is raped by a group of soldiers.\r\rGenjur_ is visited by a noblewoman and her female servant, who order several pieces of pottery and tell him to take them to the Kutsuki mansion. Genjur_ learns that Nobunaga's soldiers have attacked the manor and killed all who lived there, except Lady Wakasa and her servant. He also learns that Lady Wakasa's father haunts the manor. Genjur_ is seduced by Lady Wakasa, and she convinces him to marry her. Meanwhile, Nakanog_ is under attack. Miyagi and her son hide from soldiers and are found by an elderly woman who hurries them to safety. In the woods, several soldiers desperately search her for food. She fights with the soldiers and is stabbed. She collapses with her son still clutching her back.\r\rT_bei steals the severed head of a general, which he presents to the commander of the victorious side. He is rewarded with armor, a mount, and a retinue. T_bei later rides into the marketplace on his new horse, eager to return home to show his wife. However, he visits a brothel and finds her working there as a prostitute. T_bei promises to buy back her honor. Later, the two return to Nakanog_, T_bei throwing his armor into a river along the way.\r\rGenjur_ meets a priest, who tells him to return to his loved ones or certain death awaits him. When Genjur_ mentions the noblewoman, the priest reveals that the noblewoman is dead and must be exorcised, and then invites Genjur_ to his home where he paints Buddhist prayers on his body. Genjur_ returns to the Kutsuki mansion. He admits that he is married, has a child and wishes to return home. Lady Wakasa will not let him go. They admit they are spirits, returned to this world so that Lady Wakasa, who was slain before she knew love, could experience its joys. She tells him to wash away the Buddhist symbols. Genjur_ reaches for a sword, throws himself out of the manor, and passes out. The next day, he is awakened by soldiers. They accuse him of stealing the sword, but he denies it, saying it is from the Kutsuki mansion. The soldiers laugh at him, saying the Kutsuki mansion was burned down over a month ago. Genjur_ arises and finds the mansion he has lived in is nothing more than a pile of burnt wood. The soldiers confiscate his money; but because Shibata's army burned down the prison, they leave Genjur_ in the rubble. He returns home by foot, searching for his wife.\r\rMiyagi, delighted to see him, will not let him tell of his terrible mistake. Genjur_ holds his sleeping son in his arms, and eventually lies down to sleep. The next morning, Genjur_ wakes to the village chief knocking on his door. He is surprised to see Genjur_ home, and expresses concern. He explains that he has been caring for Genjur_'s son, and that the boy must have come to his old home in the middle of the night. Genjur_ calls for Miyagi. The neighbor asks if Genjur_ is dreaming, as his wife is dead. Miyagi's spirit tells Genjur_: ""I am always with you"", while he continues on pottery, and their son offers food to her. As with others, the film closes with _ (owari, the end), in handwritten cursive.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NDE0OTI3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjEyMTIzMQ@@._V1._CR15,24,325,474_UY268_CR1,0,182,268_AL_.jpg",0.193135207,,,50,,APPROVED,1222,8.2,12682,9/7/54,0,96,,96 min,0,0,0,Ugetsu,movie,1,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugetsu,"Matsutar_« Kawaguchi (adaptation), Hisakazu Tsuji (idea), Akinari Ueda (stories), Yoshikata Yoda (screenplay)",1953

Bouquet then addresses the sadism inflicted upon the doomed inmates, including torture, scientific and medical ""experiments"", executions, and prostitution.

Giovanni's new book, La stagione (The Season), has just been published and Tommaso praises his friend's work. They drink champagne but Tommaso is unable to hide his severe pain. Shaken by the sight of her dying friend, Lidia leaves saying she'll visit tomorrow. Giovanni stays behind and as he leaves his friend's room, a sick and uninhibited young woman attempts to seduce him before being interrupted by the nurses.\r\rOutside the hospital, Giovanni sees his wife crying but does not comfort her. As they drive off, he tells her about his ""unpleasant"" encounter with the sick woman and is surprised when Lidia dismisses the incident. They drive to a party celebrating Giovanni's new book, which has been well received. Giovanni signs books, while his wife looks on from a distance. After a while Lidia leaves, still shaken by Tommaso's condition. She wanders the streets of Milan, ending up in the neighborhood where she and Giovanni lived as newlyweds. She comes across a brutal street fight which she tries to stop and later she watches rockets being set off in a field.\r\rBack at the apartment, Giovanni finally hears from Lidia and he picks her up from the old neighborhood, which seems to have little sentimental value for him. Later they decide to go to a nightclub, where they watch a mesmerizing and seductive performance by a female dancer and engage in small talk. ""I no longer have inspirations, only recollections"", Giovanni tells his wife. Lidia suggests they leave the club and attend a swanky party thrown by a millionaire businessman. ""One must do something"", she says.\r\rAt the party, Giovanni socializes with the guests and appears to be in his element, while Lidia walks around in a state of boredom. They spend some time with the host, Mr. Gherardini (Vincenzo Corbella), who seems disappointed by his wealth and exchange insincere flattery. Giovanni wanders off and meets Valentina Gherardini (Monica Vitti), the host's lively, charming daughter. As they flirt, she teaches him a game she just invented, sliding a compact across the floor and soon others gather to watch their competition. Later they see each alone and Giovanni makes a pass at her, kissing her while Lidia looks on from the floor above.\r\rLater Mr. Gherardini meets privately with Giovanni and offers him an executive position with his company, to write the firm's history. Giovanni is reluctant to accept and leaves the offer open. With Lidia's family's wealth and his earnings from publishing, he doesn't need the money. Lidia calls the hospital and learns that Tommaso died ten minutes earlier. Overwhelmed with grief, she watches from a window as the guests enjoy themselves. Later she sits at a table opposite an empty chair. Giovanni walks over and does not sit down and Lidia does not tell him about Tommaso's death. Giovanni sees Valentina and follows after her, leaving Lidia alone.\r\rLidia walks to the band and appears to enjoy the music. A man named Roberto (Giorgio Negro), who had been following her, approaches, asks her to dance and she accepts. A sudden shower sends the guests running for cover and some jump in the pool like children. As Lidia is about to jump in from the diving board, Roberto stops her, takes her to his car and they drive off. She enjoys Roberto's company and their conversation but as he's about to kiss her, Lidia turns away from him, saying ""I'm sorry, I can't.""\r\rBack at the party, Giovanni searches through the crowd and finds Valentina alone, watching the rain. She tells him she's smart enough not to break up a marriage and instructs him to spend the rest of the evening with his wife. Giovanni reveals that he's going through a ""crisis"" common among writers but in his case it is affecting his whole life. They return to the guests, just as Lidia and Roberto return from their drive. Giovanni seems slightly annoyed by Lidia's behavior. Valentina invites Lidia to dry off in her room, where Lidia confronts her directly about her husband. As the women chat, Giovanni overhears his wife tell Valentina that she feels like dying and putting an end to the agony of her life. Noticing Giovanni, she tells him she is not a bit jealous of his playing around with Valentina. They say goodbye to Valentina and leave the party at morning's first light, with the jazz band playing for the few couples still listening.\r\rAs Giovanni and Lidia walk away across Gherardini's private golf course, they talk about the job offer that Giovanni says he'll turn down. Lidia finally tells him about Tommaso's death and recounts how Tommaso used to support her and offer his affections to her but she eventually chose Giovanni because she loved him. She tells him, ""I feel like dying because I no longer love you"". Giovanni recognizes the failure of their marriage but tells her, ""Let's try to hold onto something we're sure of. I love you. I'm sure I'm still in love with you"". Lidia takes out a love letter Giovanni wrote to her just before they were married and reads it aloud. Giovanni asks who wrote it and she replies, ""You did"". Giovanni embraces and kisses her but she resists, saying she no longer loves him and nor does he love her. Unable to acknowledge his own failure, Giovanni continues to make love to her in a bunker on the golf course, beneath a grey morning sky.\r",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyODI2OTg4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkwMzg4OTE@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.794224062,,,,,NOT RATED,1222,7.9,9829,2/19/62,0,115,,115 min,0,0,0,La Notte,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Notte,"Michelangelo Antonioni (story), Ennio Flaiano (story), Tonino Guerra (story), Michelangelo Antonioni (screenplay), Ennio Flaiano (screenplay), Tonino Guerra (screenplay)",1961

When tragedy befalls her, his grief lasts months; finally he rejoins the colorful life around...","In a small Hutsul village in the Carpathian mountains of Ukraine, a young man, Ivan, falls in love with the daughter of the man who killed his father. Though their families share a bitter enmity, Ivan and Marichka have known each other since childhood. In preparation for their marriage, Ivan leaves the village to work and earn money for a household. While he is gone, Marichka accidentally slips into a river and drowns while trying to rescue a lost lamb.\r\rIvan returns and falls into despair after seeing Marichka's body. He continues to work, enduring a period of joyless toil, until he meets another woman, Palagna, while shoeing a horse. Ivan and Palagna get married in a traditional Hutsul wedding in which they are blindfolded and yoked together. The marriage quickly turns sour, however, as Ivan remains obsessed with the memory of Marichka. Estranged from her emotionally distant husband, Palagna becomes involved with a local sorcerer, while Ivan begins to experience hallucinations.\r\rAt a tavern, Ivan witnesses the sorcerer embrace Palagna and strike one of his friends. Roused into an uncharacteristic fury, Ivan snatches up his axe, only to be struck down by the sorcerer. Ivan stumbles into the nearby woods and perceives Marichka's spirit to be with him, reflected in the water and gliding amongst the trees. As reality merges into dream, the colorless shade of Marichka reaches out across a great space and touches Ivan's outstretched hand. Ivan screams and dies. The community gives him a traditional Hutsul burial while children watch through crossbraced windows.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMjA3Mzk3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg4MTEyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.907092156,,,,,N/A,1223,8.1,3494,10/18/65,1,"97,Soviet Union:110",original uncut version,97 min,0,0,0,Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_of_Forgotten_Ancestors,"Ivan Chendej (screenplay), Mikhaylo Kotsyubinsky (novel), Sergei Parajanov (screenplay)",1965

It is obvious that there have been attempts to prevent the speechäó»s delivery. The venue has been changed to a much smaller hall and logistical problems have appeared out of nowhere. As the Deputy crosses the street from the hall after giving his speech, a delivery truck speeds past him and a man on the open truck bed strikes him down with a club. The injury eventually proves fatal, and by that time it is already clear to the viewer that the police have manipulated witnesses to force the conclusion that the victim was simply run over by a drunk driver.\r\rHowever, they do not control the hospital, where the autopsy disproves their interpretation. The examining magistrate (Trintignant), with the assistance of a photojournalist (Perrin), now uncovers sufficient evidence to indict not only the two right-wing militants who committed the murder, but also four high-ranking military police officers. The action of the film concludes with one of the Deputy's associates rushing to see the Deputy's widow (Papas) to give her the surprising news of the officers' indictments.\r\rAn epilogue provides a synopsis of the subsequent turns of events. Instead of the expected positive outcome, the prosecutor is mysteriously removed from the case, key witnesses die under suspicious circumstances, the assassins receive (relatively) short sentences, the officers receive only administrative reprimands, the Deputy's close associates die or are deported, and the photojournalist is sent to prison for disclosing official documents.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3NjI0OTI2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk1MDA4Mg@@._V1_UY268_CR4,0,182,268_AL_.jpg",0.162385395,,,,,M,1222,8.2,16157,12/8/69,0,127,,127 min,0,0,1,Z,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_(1969_film),"Vasilis Vasilikos (novel), Jorge Sempr__n",1969

Among other things, Crabb claims to have had been a captive of the Cheyenne, a gunslinger, an associate of Wild Bill Hickok, a scout for General George Armstrong Custer, and the sole survivor of the Battle of Little Bighorn.\r\rJack begins his story in a flashback to 1859 when he was 10-years-old where he and his older sister Caroline (Carole Androsky) survive the massacre of their parents by the Pawnee, and are taken back to a Cheyenne village. Caroline escapes, but Jack is reared by the good-hearted tribal leader Old Lodge Skins. As Jack gets older, he unwittingly makes an enemy of another boy, Younger Bear; however, Younger Bear eventually owes his life to Jack since he saved his life from a Pawnee Indian. Jack is given the name ""Little Big Man"" because he is short but very brave. In 1865, when Jack is 16, he is captured by U.S. cavalry troopers and renounces his Native American upbringing in order to save himself. He is put in the care of Reverend Silas Pendrake and his sexually frustrated wife, Louise, who tries to seduce Jack. When he witnesses Mrs. Pendrake having sex with the soda shop owner, Jack leaves the Pendrake household, and religion.\r\rThe following year, Jack becomes the apprentice of the snake-oil salesman Merriweather. The two are tarred and feathered when their customers realize that Merriweather's products are fraudulent. One of the angry customers is Jack's now-grown sister, Caroline, with whom he reunites. She attempts to mold her brother into a gunslinger named the Soda Pop Kid. Jack meets Wild Bill Hickok at a saloon, and Hickok takes a liking to the young man. When Hickok is forced to kill a man in self-defense, Jack loses his taste for gunslinging and Caroline deserts him.\r\rAnother year or so later, Jack becomes a partner in a general store and marries a Swedish woman named Olga (Kelly Jean Peters). Unfortunately, Jack's business partner turns out to be a thieving scoundrel. The famous cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer suggests the couple restart their lives further west and assures them they have nothing to fear of Indians. They set out, but their stagecoach is ambushed by Cheyenne warriors. Olga is abducted and Jack sets out in search for her. He is reunited with Old Lodge Skins. Younger Bear has become a contrary, a warrior who does everything in reverse. Jack makes friends with the hwame Little Horse, but continues on his search for Olga.\r\rJack eventually becomes a ""muleskinner"" in Custer's 7th Cavalry. He takes part in a battle against the Cheyenne, but when the troopers begin killing women and children, Jack turns on them. Jack discovers a Cheyenne woman, Sunshine (Aimí©e Eccles), giving birth. He returns with her to Old Lodge Skins's tribe. Sunshine becomes his wife and bears him a child. Jack again encounters Younger Bear, not a Contrary anymore, who is now the henpecked husband of the long-lost Olga. Olga does not recognize Jack, who makes no attempt to make her remember. Sunshine asks Jack to take in her three widowed sisters as wives and to father children with them. He is reluctant at first, but finally agrees.\r\rCuster and the 7th Cavalry make a surprise attack on the Cheyenne camp at the Washita River. A now-blind and elderly Old Lodge Skins is saved by Jack, but Sunshine, their child, and her sisters are killed. Jack tries to infiltrate Custer's camp to exact revenge, but loses his nerve. Disheartened, Jack becomes the town drunk in Deadwood, South Dakota. While in a drunken stupor, he is recognized by Wild Bill Hickok, who gives him money to get cleaned up. Hickok is shot and killed while playing cards and, with his last breath, asks Jack to bring some money to a widow he was having an affair with. Jack visits the widow, now a prostitute who turns out to be Louise Pendrake. Jack gives her the money that Hickok intended for her to use to start a new life, but rebuffs her sexual advances. This scene provides an homage to Hoffman's role in the movie _The Graduate_ and his seduction by Mrs. Robinson.\r\rJack soon becomes a trapper and hermit. His mind becomes unhinged after coming across an empty trap with a severed animal limb. He prepares to commit suicide, but sees Custer and his troops marching nearby, and decides to return to his quest for revenge. Custer hires him as a scout, reasoning that anything Jack says will be a lie, thus serving as a perfect reverse barometer. Jack tricks Custer into leading his troops into a trap at the Little Bighorn by truthfully telling Custer of the overwhelming force of Native Americans hidden within the valley. As Custer's troops are slaughtered by the combined Sioux and Cheyenne group, he begins to rave insanely. The mad Custer attempts to shoot Jack, but is shot and killed by Younger Bear, who then carries Jack away from the battlefield. Having thus discharged his life debt, Younger Bear tells Jack that the next time they meet, he can kill Jack without becoming an evil person.\r\rBack at the Indian camp, Jack accompanies Old Lodge Skins to a nearby hill, the Indian Burial Ground, where the old man, dressed in full Chief's regalia, has declared ""It is a good day to die"", and decides to end his life with dignity. He offers his spirit to the Great Spirit, and lies down at his spot at the Indian Burial Ground to wait for death. Instead, it begins to rain.

After a quick fight, Shaft dodges one of them who goes out the window, while the other surrenders and reveals to him that Bumpy Jonas, the leader of a Harlem based Organized Crime Family, wanted Shaft bought uptown to Harlem for a meeting.\r\rAt the police station, Shaft lies to Lt. Androzzi and the Detective assigned to the second gangster's death at Shaft's Office, by saying that his friend was in an ""accident"". He is allowed to return to the streets for 48 hours. Shaft arranges a meeting with Bumpy, the leader of these gangsters, in his office. It turns out Bumpy's daughter has been kidnapped, and Shaft is asked to enable her safe return.\r\rAfter tracking down Ben Buford as Bumpy suggested a big shoot out ensues, Shaft is told by Vic after the shooting that Shaft himself, and not Ben, was the target, and that tensions brewing between the uptown hoods belonging to Bumpy Jonas and the downtown Mafiosi have culminated in a couple of murders. but the perception is black against white to the general public, with the possibility of an escalation into full-blown race war on the streets of the city. He also shows Shaft some pictures of two of the Mafia men who just arrived in New York. Vic begs Shaft to explain what's going on, though Vic already knew Bumpy was looking for Shaft.\r\rStreetwise, Shaft surmises that mobsters are watching his pad from a local bar. Shaft pretends to be a barkeep and calls the police to have the mobsters arrested. Shaft later goes to the police station to set a meeting to find where Bumpy's daughter is being held captive.\r\rVic tells Shaft that the room that he was in at the station house was bugged and he is supposed to bring him in for questioning, but instead leaves. Ben and Shaft go to the apartment where Marcy Jonas is being held to make sure she's alive. Once there, a gunfight ensues during which two hoods get killed and Shaft takes a bullet in the shoulder.\r\rShaft goes home and receives medical attention from a doctor working underground with him. Shaft tells Ben to round up his men and meet him at the hotel where Marcy has been taken, to prepare to get her back. He also calls Bumpy to tell him his daughter is fine and he is going to need some taxicabs to meet him at the hotel for the getaway.\r\rShaft's plan resembles a military commando-style operation. Ben's men all dress as hotel workers to avoid arousing suspicion. Shaft and one of Ben's men go to the roof and prepare to enter the room where Marcy is being held captive. Shaft's plan is to cause a distraction with an explosive thrown through the window of Marcy's room while Ben and his men come down the hall and deal with the Mafia men as they leave their rooms.\r\rThe rescue plan is successful. Marcy is spirited out of the hotel into one of the waiting taxicabs. As the others get away in the remaining cabs, Shaft walks to a phone booth to call Vic.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwNzQyMTg5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzQzMzk4._V1_SX300.jpg,0.409857023,,,,,R,22100,6.6,11374,7/2/71,0,100,,100 min,0,0,1,Shaft,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaft_(1971_film),"Ernest Tidyman (screenplay), John D.F.

Seeing potential in the youngster, Tully suggests that Munger look up his former manager and trainer, Ruben (Nicholas Colasanto). Tully later tells combative barfly Oma (Tyrrell) and her easygoing boyfriend Earl (Curtis Cokes) how impressed he is with the kid. Newly inspired, Tully decides to get back into boxing himself.\r\rTully's life has been a mess ever since his wife left him. He drinks too much, cannot hold down a job, and picks fruit and vegetables with migrant workers to make ends meet. He still blames Ruben for mishandling his last fight.\r\rTully tries moving in with Oma after Earl is sent to prison for a few months, but their relationship is rocky. Earl, still paying the rent, returns to assure him that the alcoholic Oma wants nothing more to do with Tully.\r\rMunger loses his first fight, his nose broken, and is knocked out in his next bout as well. He gets pressured into marriage by Faye (Candy Clark) because a baby's on the way, so he picks fruit in the fields for a few dollars.\r\rFor his first bout back, Tully is matched against a tough Mexican boxer named Lucero (Sixto Rodriguez), who is also of an advanced age and in considerable pain. They knock each other down before Tully is declared the winner. His celebration is brief when Tully discovers that he will be paid only $100. He ends his business relationship with Ruben and goes back to his old ways.\r\rMunger is returning home from a fight one night when he sees Tully in the street, drunk. Munger tries to ignore him, but when Tully asks to have a drink, he reluctantly agrees to coffee. The two men sit and drink and Tully looks around at all the people immediately around him, all of whom now seem at an impassable distance. Munger says he needs to leave, but Tully asks him to stay and talk a while. Munger agrees, and the two men sit drinking their coffee together in silence.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNjk1MTcxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjA2OTc5._V1_SX300.jpg,0.56827136,,,,,PG,12211,7.5,4688,7/26/72,0,100,,100 min,0,1,0,Fat City,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_City_(film),"Leonard Gardner (screenplay), Leonard Gardner (novel)",1972

The route has to be changed, which will require it to go through Rock Ridge, a frontier town where everyone has the last name of ""Johnson"" (including a ""Howard Johnson,"" a ""Dr. Samuel Johnson,"" a ""Van Johnson"" and an ""Olson N. Johnson""). The conniving State Attorney General Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) wants to buy the land along the new railroad route cheaply by driving out the townspeople. He sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky assistant Taggart (Slim Pickens), to scare them away, prompting the townsfolk to demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane (Mel Brooks) appoint a new sheriff. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to select Bart (Cleavon Little), a black railroad worker who was about to be hanged, as he believes a black lawman will so offend the townspeople that they will either abandon Rock Ridge or lynch the new sheriff, with either result paving the way for him to take over the town.\r\rWith his quick wits and the assistance of drunken gunslinger Jim (Gene Wilder), also known as ""The Waco Kid"" (""I must have killed more men than Cecil B. DeMille""),[4] Bart works to overcome the townsfolk's hostile reception. He defeats and befriends Mongo (Alex Karras), an immensely strong, slow-thinking (but surprisingly philosophical) henchman sent by Taggart and Lyle to kill Bart, and then beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtupp (Madeline Kahn) at her own game. Lamarr is furious that his plans keep failing and decides to destroy Rock Ridge with a newly recruited and diverse army of thugs.\r\rBart gathers the town, along with the railroad workers, three miles east of Rock Ridge to build a fake town as a diversion. The workers labor all night to build a perfect replica, but with no people in it Bart realises it won't fool Lamarr's villains. Ordering the townspeople to make ""exact replicas of themselves,"" Bart leaves with Jim and Mongo to construct a tollbooth. The booth delays the raiding party when they have to go back for ""a shitload of dimes.""\r\rOnce through the tollbooth, Lamarr's villains attack the fake town populated with dummies, which Bart boobytrapped with several dynamite bombs. Bart tries setting off the bombs but is unsuccessful as the detonator does not work. Jim is given the task of exploding the bombs, and fires his pistol at them. After the bombs explode, launching bad guys skyward, the Rock Ridgers attack the villains.\r\rThe resulting fight between the townsfolk and Lamarr's army of thugs breaks the fourth wall, literally. The fight spills out from the Warner Bros. film lot into a neighboring musical set being directed by Buddy Bizarre (Dom DeLuise), then into the studio commissary, and ultimately into the surrounding streets (specifically, Olive Avenue in Burbank). The citizens chase the villains back to Rock Ridge to destroy them, but Lamarr takes a taxi "". . . off this picture."" He arrives at Grauman's Chinese Theatre to watch the ""premiere"" of Blazing Saddles. Unfortunately, he sees on the movie screen that Bart has arrived outside the theatre. Bart ends up killing Lamarr by shooting him in the groin. Bart and Jim then go into the theatre to watch the end of the film, where Bart decides to leave Rock Ridge, much to the sadness of the townspeople and the railroad workers, for his work there is done.

Fassbinder plays...,"Franz Bieberkopf[3] is a sweet and unsophisticated working-class homosexual who works in a carnival as ""Fox, the Talking Head"". He finds himself without a job when his boyfriend, Klaus, the carnival owner, is arrested for tax fraud. Now jobless, Fox visits Hedwig, his sister, who likes to drink and is in no mood or situation to provide any help. After losing the remaining money that he had, Fox turns to tricks in order to buy the lottery ticket he is convinced will bring him his fortune. Cruising in a public restroom, Fox meets an older man, Max, a sophisticated antique art dealer, who is not willing to give Fox the small amount of money he needs. Undeterred, Fox stops at a flowers shop and swindles the ten marks he needs from the overweight gay florist. With that money, Fox buys a lottery ticket as the newsagent is closing.\r\rA month later, Fox is at a party where Max introduces him to his cultivated gay friends. One of them, the handsome but hypocritical Eugen, shuns Fox for his proletarian manners, but quickly changes his mind when he learns that Fox has won 500,000 German marks in the lottery. The unscrupulous Eugen immediately leaves his boyfriend, Philip, and, with no effort, entices Fox who he finds easy prey. They spend the night at Eugenäó»s apartment, starting a relationship. The next morning, Philip finds them together, but Eugen convinces Philip to step aside for some time. Later, Fox and Eugen go to a working-class gay bar and then to a posh restaurant, where they meet Eugen's two other friends. Eugen then takes Fox round his new factory. Later, Fox goes to a gay spa and talks to Max, who suggests investing in Eugen's company. Fox then takes out 100,000 marks and gives them to Eugen; they go to the factory to tell Eugen's father.\r\rEugen gets evicted from his apartment for moral reasons (two men living together); he suggests that Fox buy his own apartment. They visit one and Fox buys it, then buys furniture from Max for 80,000 marks. They go clothes-shopping at Eugen's ex-boyfriend's, Philip's shop, and again Fox pays for it all. Later, they have lunch at Eugen's parents' home and Fox has no table manners. He then signs a contract for the 100,000-Mark loan, which he barely understands. (Eugen's attorney, realizing that Fox is barely literate, gives him only a cursory, patronizing explanation of the contract before he signs.) Fox and Eugen go to the gay bar, and find that Klaus has been released from prison; Fox lends him 30,000 marks, and Eugen is jealous. At the apartment, they throw a party, during which Philip whispers to Max that he might be living there later; the party ends abruptly when Hedwig, drunk, makes a fuss. To iron out their disagreements, they decide to go on holiday. At the travel agent's office, Eugen decides on Marrakech, Morocco; Fox pays for it again. In Morocco, they pick up a local male prostitute (El Hedi ben Salem), and go to a restaurant with him; he is not let into the hotel because he is an Arab. The hotel assistant says, however, that they have male escorts specially for the hotel.\r\rBack from the holiday, the couple learn the company is bankrupt; the workers cannot be paid. Fox suggests giving his flat to Eugen, so the bank lets him take a loan to pay them. Eugen goes to the opera with Max, leaving Fox alone; Fox goes to the gay bar, throws a fit, gives 500 marks to the florist and runs off. The next day at the factory, Fox makes a mistake with some imprints; Eugen's father tells him off. Later, they all have dinner together and again, Fox has no table manners or savoir-faire. Fox goes to a pub and propositions two American soldiers, but nothing happens, they just leave. He drives to the gay bar, the florist hits on him and Fox slaps him; Fox has a short heart attack. Back at the flat, he tells Eugen about the attack but his lover doesn't seem to care. The next day, he goes to a doctor, who gives him sedative pills.\r\rFox breaks up with Eugen, who says he is taking the apartment to make up for the bungled imprints. (Although the printing error cost the business 150,000 marks, Fox does not realize that it was covered by Eugen's insurance, ironically purchased with Fox's loan.) At the factory the next day, he is told that the 100,000 marks from the contract was paid back in his monthly salary, he didn't have to work. Later he goes to the apartment and he is not let in; Eugen has resumed his relationship with a former boyfriend. Fox then goes to his sister's, they have an argument and he goes to sleep in his car. The next day he sells his new car (a De Tomaso Pantera) for only 8000 marks. Later in the gay bar, Fox sees the American soldiers and they ask him how much he pays; he starts sobbing as the florist tries to console him.\r\rThe next day Fox lies dead on the floor in the underground; he has killed himself with the pills.

He becomes a taxi driver to cope with chronic insomnia, driving passengers every night around the boroughs of New York City. He also spends time in seedy porn theaters and keeps a diary. Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her, and takes her out for coffee. On a later date, he takes her to see a Swedish sex education film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers are rebuffed, so he berates her at the campaign office, before being kicked out by Tom.\r\rTravis confides in fellow taxi driver Wizard about his thoughts, which are beginning to turn violent, but Wizard assures him that he will be fine. Disgusted by the street crime and prostitution that he witnesses throughout the city, Travis finds an outlet for his frustration and begins a program of intense physical training. He buys guns from dealer Easy Andy and constructs a sleeve gun to attach on his arm, with which he practices drawing his weapons. One night, Travis enters a convenience store moments before a man attempts to rob it, and he shoots the robber. The shop owner takes responsibility and Travis leaves. On another night, teenage prostitute Iris[8] enters Travis's cab, attempting to escape her pimp Matthew ""Sport"" Higgins. Sport drags Iris from the cab and throws Travis a crumpled twenty-dollar bill, which continually reminds him of her. Some time later, Travis hires Iris, but instead of having sex with her, attempts to dissuade her from continuing in prostitution. He fails to completely turn her from her course, but she does agree to meet with him for breakfast the next day, and Travis becomes obsessed with helping her return to her parents' home. Travis leaves a letter to Iris at his apartment saying he will soon be dead, and inside the letter, money for her to return home.\r\rAfter shaving his head into a mohawk, Travis attends a public rally, where he attempts to assassinate Senator Palantine, but Secret Service agents notice him and he flees without taking a shot. He returns to his apartment and then drives to the East Village, where he confronts Sport. Travis shoots Sport, then walks into Iris's brothel and shoots off the bouncer's fingers. After a wounded Sport shoots Travis, grazing his neck, Travis shoots and kills him. Iris's client, a mobster, appears and shoots Travis in the arm, but Travis reveals his sleeve gun and kills the gangster. The bouncer continues to harass Travis, causing Travis to stab him in the hand and shoot him in the head to kill him. As a horrified Iris cries, Travis attempts suicide but, out of ammunition, resigns himself to a sofa until police arrive. When they do, he places his index finger against his temple gesturing the act of shooting himself. While recuperating, Travis receives a letter from Iris's parents, who thank him for saving her, and the media hail him as a hero. Travis then returns to his job and encounters Betsy as a fare. She discusses his newfound fame, but he denies being a hero and drops her at her place free of charge. He glances at her in his rear view mirror as he drives away.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1Nzg3MDQwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDE2NDU2MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.148394598,47,52,31,43,R,1222,8.4,434497,2/8/76,0,"113,Spain:110",cut version,113 min,0,0,0,Taxi Driver,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi_Driver,Paul Schrader,1976

Her parents, upset by her dreams of grandeur, send her to board with her grandmother in hopes of teaching her proper manners and behaviour. She is soon courted by two local men, jackaroo Frank Hawdon (Robert Grubb), whom she ignores, and well-to-do childhood friend Harry Beecham (Sam Neill), whom she grows increasingly fond of.\r\rSybylla is sent to spend time at the Beecham's estate, and the feelings between her and Harry grow. She returns to her grandmothers' home when Harry is sent on a tour of their properties, with everyone on both estates coyly approving of their romance. Frank attempts to derail the couple through rumours, which leads to increasing tensions between the two. The two take turns attempting to make the other jealous at a ball, leading to Harry's surprise proposal. Sybylla gruffly rejects him, to everyone's surprise. Harry later reveals his rush was to protect Sybylla from his potential financial collapse. Sybylla counters by asking Harry to wait while she discovers herself, and asks him to delay his proposal for perhaps two years.\r\rSybylla is soon summoned to meet with her grandmother, where she learns she has been forced to take a job as governess/housekeeper to the family of an illiterate neighbour to whom her father owes money. Working in squalor, she manages to teach the children to read using the newspapers wallpapering their home. To her delight, she is sent home when the parents become convinced (incorrectly) she is wooing their eldest son. Harry visits and proposes again, but she again rejects him, stating her intent is to become a writer.\r\rThe movie ends with her reading (n voiceover) from her novel, My Brilliant Career, before sending it off for publication.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwOTE5NTkxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTgwMTkyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.968135422,,,,,G,12211,7.4,2329,8/17/79,1,100,,100 min,0,0,0,My Brilliant Career,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Brilliant_Career_(film),"Miles Franklin (novel), Eleanor Witcombe",1979

But he was framed for jury tampering some years back by the firm's senior partner because he was going to expose their corrupt practices. Although he retains his license to practice law, Frank has become an alcoholic ambulance chaser who has had only four cases over the last three years, all of which he has lost.\r\rAs a favor, his former teacher and friend Mickey (Jack Warden) sends him a medical malpractice case in which it's all but assured that the defense will settle for a large amount. The case involves a young woman who was given an anesthetic during childbirth, after which she choked on her own vomit and was deprived of oxygen. The young woman is now on a respirator in a persistent vegetative state. Her sister and brother-in-law are hoping for a settlement in order to give her proper care. Frank assures them they have a strong case. Meanwhile, Frank, who is lonely, becomes romantically involved with Laura (Charlotte Rampling), a woman he meets at a local bar.\r\rFrank visits the comatose woman and is deeply affected. He then meets with the Bishop of the Archdiocese of Boston, which owns the Catholic hospital where the incident took place. As expected, the Bishop's representative offers a substantial amount of money äóñ $210,000 äóñ to settle out of court, but Frank declines the offer as he fears that this may be his last chance to do something right as a lawyer, and that merely taking the handout would render him ""lost"". Everyone, including the presiding judge and the victim's relatives, is stunned by Frank's decision (Frank fails to communicate the offer to his client's family before rejecting it).\r\rThings quickly go wrong for Frank: his client's brother-in-law finds out from ""the other side"" that he has turned down a $210,000 settlement, and angrily confronts Frank; his star medical expert disappears; a hastily arranged substitute's credentials and testimony are called into serious question on the witness stand. His opponent, the high-priced attorney Ed Concannon (James Mason), has at his disposal a large legal team that is masterful with the press; the presiding judge (Milo O'Shea) makes deliberate efforts to obstruct Frank's questioning of his expert; and no one who was in the operating room is willing to testify that there was any negligence.\r\rFrank's big break comes when he discovers that Kaitlin Costello (Lindsay Crouse), the nurse who admitted his client to the hospital, is now a preschool teacher in New York. Frank travels there to track her down, leaving Mickey and Laura working together in Frank's Boston office. Frank confronts Costello, asking, ""Will you help me?"" We don't see her answer.\r\rMeanwhile in Boston, Mickey is looking for cigarettes in Laura's handbag and discovers a check from Concannon's law firm. He infers that she is a mole, providing information on their legal strategy to the opposing lawyers.\r\rMickey flies to New York to tell Frank that Laura has been betraying them. He suggests to Frank that it would be easy to get the case declared a mistrial, but Frank decides to continue. Shortly thereafter, Frank meets Laura, who has also traveled to New York. In a display of cold fury, Frank strikes her in the face, knocking her to the floor.\r\rIn an emotional scene, Costello testifies that, shortly after the patient had become comatose, the anesthesiologist (one of the two doctors on trial, along with the Archdiocese of Boston) told her to change her notes on the admitting form to hide his fatal error. She had written down that the patient had had a full meal only one hour before being admitted. The doctor had failed to read the admitting notes. Thus, in ignorance, he gave her an anesthetic that should never be given to a patient with a full stomach. As a result, the patient vomited and choked.\r\rCostello further testifies that, when the anesthesiologist realized his mistake, he met with Costello in private and forced her to change the number ""1"" to the number ""9"" on her admitting notes. But Costello made a photocopy of the notes before she made the change, which she brought with her to court. She was subsequently fired, leading her to exclaim in court, ""Who are these men? I wanted to be a nurse!"" But Concannon quickly turns the situation around by getting the judge to declare the nurse's testimony stricken from the record on technicalities. Frank's case seems hopeless, but he delivers a brief, weighty closing argument, telling the jury ""you are the law"" and entreating them to seek ""truth and justice"" in their hearts before they vote.\r\rIn the penultimate scene, the jury äóñ disregarding the judge's instructions to ignore the nurse's testimony äóñ announces that they have found in favor of Frank's clients. The foreman then asks the judge whether the jury can award more than the amount the plaintiffs sought. The judge resignedly replies that they can, but the amount they decide on is not revealed. As Frank is congratulated by his clients, Mickey, and colleagues and strangers alike, he catches a glimpse of Laura watching him across the atrium.\r\rOne night, Laura, in a drunken stupor on her bed, drops her whiskey on the floor, drags the phone toward her, and picks up the receiver. The final shot is of Frank in his office looking thoughtful, drinking coffee out of a paper cup, and ignoring the persistent ringing of his phone.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MzMwMzAzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYyMjA0Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.071719339,,,,91,R,2311,7.8,23545,12/17/82,0,129,,129 min,0,0,0,The Verdict,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verdict,"Barry Reed (based upon the novel by), David Mamet (screenplay)",1982

Part of the contract is that Mrs. Herbert agrees ""to meet Mr. Neville in private and to comply with his requests concerning his pleasure with me."" Several sexual encounters between them follow, each of them acted in such a way as to emphasise reluctance or distress on the part of Mrs Herbert and sexual aggression or insensitivity on the part of Mr Neville. Whilst living on the estate, Mr. Neville gains quite a reputation with its dwellers, especially with Mrs. Herbert's son-in-law, Mr. Talmann.\r\rMrs. Herbert, wearied of meeting Mr. Neville for his pleasure, tries to terminate the contract before all of the drawings are completed and orders Mr. Neville to stop. Neville refuses to void the contract and continues as before. Then Mrs. Herbert's married but as yet childless, daughter Mrs. Talmann, who has apparently become attracted to Mr. Neville, seems to blackmail him into making a second contract in which he agrees to comply with what is described as her pleasure, rather than his äóî a reversal of the position in regard to her mother.\r\rA number of curious objects appear in Neville's drawings, which point ultimately to the murder of Mr. Herbert, whose body is discovered in the moat of the house. Mr. Neville completes his twelve drawings and leaves the house but returns to make an unlucky thirteenth drawing. In the evening, while Mr. Neville is apparently finishing the final sketch, he is approached by a masked stranger, who is obviously Mr. Talmann in disguise, who is then joined by Mr. Noyes, Mr. Seymore and the Poulencs, a pair of eccentric local landowner twins. The party accuses Mr. Neville of the murder of Mr. Herbert, for the drawings can be interpreted to suggest more than one illegal act and to implicate more than one person. After he defensively denies such accusations, the group ask Mr. Neville to remove his hat. He agrees mockingly, at which point they hit him on the head, burn out his eyes, club him to death and then throw him into the moat, at the place where Mr. Herbert's body was found.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3ODQwODE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQ5MDUyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.87705294,,,,,R,12211,7.3,6529,6/30/83,0,108,,108 min,0,0,0,The Draughtsman's Contract,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Draughtsman%27s_Contract,Peter Greenaway,1982

It is the story of a rich Manhattan playwright named Henry who goes on an exotic vacation to Egypt with companions Jason and Rita. While in Egypt, the three meet archaeologist Tom Baxter. Tom is brought back for a ""madcap Manhattan weekend"" where he falls head-over-heels for Kitty Haynes, a chanteuse at the Copacabana.\r\rAfter Cecilia sits through the film several times, Tom, noticing her, breaks the fourth wall, and emerges from the black-and-white screen into the colorful real world on the other side of the cinema's screen. He tells Cecilia that he is attracted to her after noticing her watching him so many times, and she takes him around her New Jersey town. Later, he takes her into the film and they have a great evening on the town within the film. The two fall in love. But the character's defection from the film has caused some problems. In other copies of the film, others have tried to exit the screen. The producer of the film learns that Tom has left the film, and he flies cross-country to New Jersey with actor Gil Shepherd (the ""real life"" actor playing the part of Tom in the movie). This sets up an unusual love triangle involving Tom, Gil, and Cecilia. Cecilia must choose between them and she decides to choose the real person of Gil rather than the fantasy figure of Tom. She gives up the chance to return with Tom to his world, choosing to stay with Gil and have a 'real' life. Then she breaks up with her husband.\r\rBut Gil's professions of love for Cecilia were falseäóîhe wooed her only to get Tom to return to the movie and thereby save his own Hollywood career. Gil abandons Cecilia and is seen quietly racked with guilt on his flight back to Hollywood. Having been left without a lover, job, or home, Cecilia ends up immersing herself in the frothy escapism of Hollywood once again, sitting in a theater watching Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dancing to ""Cheek-to-Cheek"" in the film Top Hat, forgetting her dire situation and losing herself in the film.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyODM2ODI0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTIwMzg4NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.948085016,,,,,PG,2311,7.8,32258,4/19/85,1,82,,82 min,0,0,0,The Purple Rose of Cairo,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Purple_Rose_of_Cairo,Woody Allen,1985

Meeting...","Miss Lucy Honeychurch is from an English village in Surrey and is on holiday in Italy with her much older cousin and chaperone, Charlotte Bartlett. Charlotte is conventionally English, with an extremely restrictive personality and tends to get her way by expressing her emotions to manipulate others. Lucy has been brought up in an upper-middle class but loving and easygoing household, and had fewer inhibitions, which creates a strong tension between herself and Charlotte. They are in contrast with the more free-thinking and free-spirited backdrop of Italy. At a small pensione Lucy meets such people as Reverend Beebe, the two Miss Alans, and the author Miss Eleanor Lavish, but most importantly, the nonconformist Mr. Emerson and his handsome, philosophical son, George, who becomes friends with Charlotte. These men, although also English, represent the forward-thinking ideals of the turn-of-the-century, seeking to leave behind the repression and caution that was the norm in Victorian times. At first, the Emersons seem strange and unfamiliar to Lucy and Charlotte. They seem sincere but unaware of finer upper class Victorian manners. Mr. Emerson offers to switch rooms with the women, who desire a room with a view. Charlotte is offended, believing him to be rude and tactless for what she perceives to be indebting them with his offer. As Lucy begins her journey to maturity, she finds herself drawn to George due to his mysterious thinking and readily expressed emotions.\r\rA number of people staying at the pension take a carriage ride in the country. A mischievous Italian driver gets back at Charlotte by misdirecting an unchaperoned Lucy to George in a barley field as he admires the view. George suddenly embraces and passionately kisses Lucy as she approaches him. Charlotte has followed Lucy, witnesses the act, and quickly stops the intimacy. George's unreserved passion shocks Lucy, but also lights a secret desire and romance in her heart. Charlotte suggests George kissing her was the act of a rake. Charlotte makes reference to a heartbreak from her youth that occurred the same way and has behaved accordingly with disgust and anger toward George. Charlotte uses guilt to coerce Lucy to secrecy to save both their reputations as a young lady and a chaperone, but it is mostly for her own benefit. Normally, if a young man kissed a young lady, an engagement should be announced to preserve her reputation, but Charlotte considers George to be an undesirable influence. Upon returning to England, Lucy tells her mother nothing and pretends to forget the incident. She accepts a marriage proposal from a wealthy and respectable but snobbish man named Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day-Lewis). However, she soon learns that both George and his father have moved to her small village and will be her neighbors due to a letter from Cecil Vyse inviting them to reside in an empty cottage.\r\rThe appearance of George soon disrupts Lucy's plans and causes her suppressed feelings to resurface, complicated by the supposed need for secrecy. Lucy consistently refuses George's pursuit of her, but mysteriously breaks off her engagement to Cecil, and makes plans to visit Greece. George has also decided that he must move for peace of mind and makes arrangements. Lucy stops by Reverend Beebe's and is confronted by George's father before they are to leave town. She suddenly realizes that the only reason that she planned to travel was to escape her feelings for George. At the end, we see George and Lucy eloped in the Italian pension where they met, in the room with the view.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyODE1NzMxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU2MTUxMDE@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.113008425,,,,,UNRATED,12211,7.4,26595,4/11/86,1,"UK:117,117",,117 min,0,0,0,A Room with a View,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Room_with_a_View_(1985_film),"E.M.

He persuades his depressive best friend Cameron Frye to join him. Ferris coaxes Cameron into taking his father's prized 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder convertible out for a spin. Sympathy spreads throughout school and the community for Ferris' faked illness, as he is wildly popular among the community and the students, inspiring a campaign to ""Save Ferris."" His absence is called into question by his suspicious sister, Jeannie, and the school's dean of students, Edward Rooney, who believes Ferris is truant, which he contends jeopardizes his ability to effectively govern the student body.\r\rBy phoning the school with a false report of her grandmother's death, the two get Ferris' girlfriend, Sloane Peterson, to come along for the day. Ferris, Sloane, and Cameron drive into downtown Chicago, leaving the Ferrari with two garage attendants, who promptly take it on a joyride. The three friends proceed to go on a lively tour of the city, including a visit to the Sears Tower's skydeck, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and lunch at a fancy restaurant called Chez Quis where Ferris poses as Abe Froman (the sausage king of Chicago). A skeptical maí¬tre'd (Jonathan Schmock) questions the authenticity of his claim and refuses to seat the group until he is tricked into it by several prank calls. The gang are nearly caught by Ferris' dad while leaving. The gang continue to enjoy themselves with visits to a Chicago Cubs game at Wrigley Field and the Art Institute of Chicago. Later, in a cab, despite their many activities, Cameron tells Ferris he has seen nothing good. This comment inspires Ferris to crash the annual Von Steuben Day Parade, dedicating to Cameron a lip-synched performance of Wayne Newton's cover of ""Danke Schoen."" Ferris proceeds to perform the Beatles' ""Twist and Shout"" on the float as a very enthusiastic crowd joins him singing and dancing.\r\rMeanwhile, Rooney tries to break into the Bueller home, but he is attacked by the family's dog. Also looking for Ferris, Jeannie returns home. She discovers that Ferris has lied and angrily attempts to call their mother. Noticing the door is unlocked, Rooney enters the house after her. Jeannie hears him enter and, believing that he is a stranger, knocks him out and calls the police. Rooney leaves to chase down his car, which is being towed for parking in front of a fire hydrant. The police arrest Jeannie for filing a false report, and while waiting at the police station, she talks to a juvenile delinquent (Charlie Sheen), who tells her not to worry about Ferris. Jeannie's mother finds her kissing the delinquent when she arrives to pick her up.\r\rAt the end of the day, the three friends retrieve the Ferrari but discover that over 100 miles have been added to the odometer. Cameron is shocked into self-analysis: he says he has allowed his fear of his father to dominate his life. Back at Cameron's house, the friends jack up the rear wheels of the car and run it in reverse, but it does not remove the miles on the odometer as they expected. Cameron unleashes his pent-up anger against his father, kicking and damaging the front of the Ferrari. He says that now is the time to stand up to his father and face the consequences of what he has done. Leaning on the car, he accidentally knocks it off the jack; it crashes through the glass wall of the garage, landing in a ravine behind the house. Ferris offers to take the blame, but Cameron insists that he will take it himself.\r\rAfter walking Sloane home, Ferris realizes he has five minutes to get home before his parents discover he is missing. Ferris is nearly run over by Jeannie, who is driving their mother home. While Mrs. Bueller is distracted, Jeannie tries to beat Ferris home so that their parents can catch him. Ferris makes it back but is caught at the back door by Rooney, who tells him to expect another year of high school under his close personal supervision. However, Jeannie has found Rooney's wallet on the kitchen floor and, with a change of heart, lets Ferris in and blackmails Rooney with this proof that he was the intruder, leaving Rooney to be attacked by the dog once again. Ferris jumps in bed just before his parents check on him, leaving them convinced he was home the whole time.\r\rDuring the credits, Rooney hobbles down the street and then hitches a ride on a school bus to the amusement of the students on the bus.\r\rIn the post-credits scene, Ferris tells the audience that the movie is over and they should go home.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMDA0NjZhZWUtNmI2NC00MmFjLTgwZDYtYzVjZmNhMDVmOTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.359670708,,,,,PG-13,1311,7.9,217209,6/11/86,0,103,,103 min,0,0,0,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_Bueller%27s_Day_Off,John Hughes,1986

The film reflects the film maker's journey - from his first film on the wind (Pour Le Mistral)to ...,"Next to a fast-spinning windmill, a young boy enters a large toy aeroplane and says he will fly to China. An old man, Joris Ivens, sits on a chair in the Gobi Desert. On the sand dunes around him a group of men are raising poles with microphones.\r\rAn old Chinese man practices martial arts with several younger men in front of a traditional Chinese building. Ivens, who is 90 years old, has been asthmatic since childhood, and asks the man how he manages to breathe so well. The literary character Sun Wukong, in a Peking opera appearance, watches from a tree. The man answers that ""the secret of breathing lies in the rhythm of the autumn wind"". The man begins to dance. Sun Wukong then throws a banana peel before the man, who slips and falls. Ivens helps him up.\r\rIvens visits the Golden Hands Buddha at the Dazu Rock Carvings. Intercut are Chinese landscapes seen from the air and footage of stormy weather. The Leshan Giant Buddha is seen. In the Gobi Desert, the team of technicians set up a camp. Ivens uses an inhaler and is swiftly examined by a doctor. A member of the group says that the wind will not appear for several days.\r\rThe following day, Ivens falls from his chair in the desert and is brought to a hospital. Sun Wukong visits him in the hospital bed. In an extended dream sequence, the spaceship from the film A Trip to the Moon brings Ivens to the Moon. There he encounters the goddess Chang'e who tells him there is no wind on the Moon. Ivens finds that remarkable. In a stylised village where a wedding is taking place, a communist representative holds a speech about how fortunate the villagers are. Sun Wukong turns up and pulls the plug to the representative's microphone, and makes the loudspeakers play Western pop music instead. Ivens is briefly seen in Sun Wukong's make-up.\r\rIvens enters a cavern, where men greet him and say that he is expected. At the end of the cavern there is a mask from which a strong wind blows from the mouth. Ivens says that he wants to meet the man who made the mask, which is arranged. The man explains the mask's mythological symbology and gives it to Ivens, who in return gives the man a print of his 1930 film Breakers.\r\rIvens is carried to the top of a mountain to record the sound of wind. Footage is seen from the Japanese invasion of China, which Ivens filmed in 1938. Footage from the air is seen of the Great Wall of China, partially covered in desert sand. Trying to film the Terracotta Army, Ivens and Marceline Loridan only obtain permission to film for ten minutes, which would not be enough. Ivens therefore buys a large number of replicas from local tourist shops to create his own army, which he arranges and films, together with choreographed men dressed up in terracotta warrior costumes.\r\rAt Ivens' camp in the Gobi Desert, an old woman approaches and says she can summon the wind by drawing a magic figure. To do this she demands two mechanical fans, which Ivens agrees to give her. Ivens explains how he for his entire career has tried to tame the wind by capturing it with the camera. The woman draws in the sand, and heavy wind begins to blow in the previously calm desert.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM1MjQxY2QtNzI3ZS00MWUwLTk5ZTgtYmUwNGQyYjY5OGQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDk1ODM3MA@@._V1_UY268_CR11,0,182,268_AL_.jpg",0.131544923,,,,,N/A,11211,7.3,455,3/19/89,0,80,,80 min,0,0,0,A Tale of the Wind,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_the_Wind,"Joris Ivens, Marceline Loridan Ivens",1988

Spica makes nightly appearances at the restaurant with his retinue of thugs. His oafish behavior causes frequent confrontations with the staff and his own customers, whose patronage he loses, but whose money he seems not to miss.\r\rForced to accompany Spica is his reluctant, well-bred wife, Georgina, who soon catches the eye of a quiet regular at the restaurant, bookshop owner Michael. Under her husband's nose, Georgina carries on an affair with Michael with the help of the restaurant staff. Ultimately Spica learns of the affair, forcing Georgina to hide out at Michael's book depository. Boarst sends food to Georgina through his young employee Pup, a boy soprano who sings while working. Spica tortures the boy before finding the bookstore's location written in a book the boy is carrying. Spica's men storm Michael's bookshop while Georgina is visiting the boy in hospital. They torture Michael to death by force-feeding him pages from his books. Georgina discovers his body when she returns.\r\rOvercome with rage and grief, she begs Boarst to cook Michael's body, and he eventually complies. Together with all the people that Spica wronged throughout the film, Georgina confronts her husband finally at the restaurant and forces him to eat a mouthful of Michael's cooked body. Spica obeys, gagging, before Georgina shoots him in the head.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTlmM2U5YmQtMTcxYy00MzgyLTkyMDItZjY5Yjc3OTJkMTAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg",0.066907444,,,,,NC-17,1211,7.5,24684,4/6/90,1,"124,USA:98",R-rated version,124 min,0,0,0,"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover",movie,0,0,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cook,_the_Thief,_His_Wife_%26_Her_Lover",Peter Greenaway,1989

As the creation of an old Inventor, Edward was a human-like boy who had everything except for hands. The Inventor suffered a fatal heart attack and died before he could give real hands to Edward.\r\rLocal Avon saleswoman Peg Boggs visits the decrepit Gothic mansion on the hill where Edward lives. She finds Edward alone. Upon realizing he is virtually harmless, she takes him to her home. Edward becomes friends with Peg's young son Kevin and her husband Bill. He later falls in love with the Boggs' beautiful teenage daughter Kim, despite her initial fear of him.\r\rPeg's neighbors are impressed by Edward's adept hedge-trimming and hair-cutting skills, though an eccentric religious fanatic named Esmeralda and Kim's overbearing boyfriend Jim are fearful and contemptuous of him. Joyce, an ageing, unfaithful housewife in the Boggs' neighborhood, has become fascinated with Edward and suggests that Edward open a hair-cutting salon with her. While examining a proposed site, she attempts to seduce him in the back room, causing Edward to leave in a panic.\r\rWanting money for a van, Jim takes advantage of Edward's ability to pick locks to break into his parents' house. The burglar alarm sounds and everyone except Edward flees after he is trapped by the automatic locks triggered by the alarm, despite Kim's insistence that they return for him. Edward is arrested and released when a psychological examination reveals that his isolation allowed him to live without a sense of reality and common sense. Infuriated by Edward's rejection, Joyce claims that he tried to rape her. During the Christmas season, Edward is feared and cast out by almost everyone except the Boggs family. When Edward returns home he reveals that he knew it was Jim's house they were trying to rob and that he did it because Kim asked him to, much to Kim's shock. This in turn causes Kim to show a sour demeanor towards Jim.\r\rWhile the family is setting up Christmas decorations, Edward creates a large angel ice sculpture (modelled on Kim). The shavings create an effect of falling snow, which Kim dances under. Jim calls out to Edward, distracting him, resulting in Edward accidentally cutting Kim's hand. Jim says that Edward intentionally harmed her and attacks him. Edward runs away, wandering the neighborhood in a rage. Kim, fed up with Jim's behavior towards Edward, breaks up with him, and he goes to his friend's van to get drunk. While Peg and Bill search for Edward, he returns and finds Kim alone in the Boggs' house. She asks Edward to hold her, but he is afraid that he will hurt her. She pulls his arms around her and they embrace. Jim returns to the Boggs' house in a drunken rage, forcing his friend to drive his van while inebriated. Kevin is almost run over, but Edward pushes him out of the way, cutting Kevin's arms and face, causing witnesses to think he is attacking him. When the police arrive, Edward flees to his hilltop mansion as the neighbors pursue.\r\rKim runs to the mansion, reuniting with Edward. Jim follows her and attacks them. Edward stabs Jim in the stomach, causing him to fall out a window to his death. Kim confesses her love for Edward and they share a kiss before saying goodbye. Kim tells the townspeople that Edward and Jim fought each other to death and tells them that the roof caved in on Edward, showing them a disembodied scissor-hand from the Inventor's lab. The neighbors return home.\r\rThe elderly woman, revealed to be Kim herself, finishes telling her granddaughter the story, saying that she never saw Edward again. She chose not to visit him because she wanted him to remember her the way she was in her youth. She believes that Edward is still alive, seemingly immortal since he can never age. It is revealed that Edward creates the town's snow by carving ice sculptures that scatter shavings over the neighborhood.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BOTE2NDExNjQxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ3NzMxMDE@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.237221844,,,,,PG-13,1311,8,319533,12/14/90,1,105,,105 min,0,0,0,Edward Scissorhands,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Scissorhands,"Tim Burton (story), Caroline Thompson (story), Caroline Thompson (screenplay)",1990

After a park worker is killed by a Velociraptor, the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand that experts visit the park and certify it as safe. Gennaro invites the mathematician Ian Malcolm while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is stunned to see three Brachiosaurus and a herd of Parasaurolophus in the distance.\r\rAt the visitor center, the group learns during a laboratory tour that the cloning was accomplished by extracting the DNA of dinosaurs from mosquitoes that had been preserved in amber. The DNA strands were incomplete, so DNA from frogs was used to fill in the gaps. The dinosaurs were all cloned genetically as females in order to prevent breeding.\r\rThe group is then joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim Murphy for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees the trip from the park's control room. The tour does not go as planned, with the dinosaurs failing to appear and a Triceratops becoming ill. As a tropical storm approaches Isla Nublar, the tour is cut short. Most of the park employees depart on a boat for the mainland and the visitors return to the electric tour vehicles, except Ellie, who stays with the park's veterinarian to study the Triceratops.\r\rDuring the storm, as night falls, Jurassic Park's computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, who has been bribed by a corporate rival to steal dinosaur embryos, deactivates the park's security system to allow him access to the embryo storage room. The power goes out, and the tour vehicles become stuck. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated, allowing the Tyrannosaurus rex to escape and attack the tour group. Grant, Lex, and Tim narrowly escape while the Tyrannosaurus devours Gennaro, injures Malcolm, and pushes one of the vehicles over an embankment. On his way to deliver the embryos to the island's docks, Nedry becomes lost in the dark, crashes his Jeep, and is killed by a Dilophosaurus.\r\rSattler assists the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, in a search for survivors, but they only find Malcolm before the Tyrannosaurus rex returns. They escape in one of the vehicles. Unable to decipher Nedry's code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer Ray Arnold opt to reboot the entire park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats to an emergency bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When he fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed as well. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the Velociraptors; Muldoon distracts the raptors while Sattler turns the power back on. She discovers Arnold's severed arm and escapes. Soon after, the raptors ambush and kill Muldoon.\r\rGrant, Tim, and Lex discover the broken shells of dinosaur eggs. Grant concludes that the dinosaurs have been breeding, which occurred because they have the genetic coding of frog DNA äóî West African bullfrogs can change their sex in a single-sex environment, making the dinosaurs able to do so as well. On the way back to the visitor center, the trio encounter a herd of Gallimimus, when suddenly the Tyrannosaurus emerges from seemingly nowhere and kills one. Grant, Tim and Lex reach the visitor center, and Grant leaves them there as he goes searching for the others. After finding the bunker, Grant and Sattler head back to the visitor center, where the children successfully evade two Velociraptors. The four head to the control room, where Lex restores full power, allowing the group to call for help. While trying to leave, they are cornered by the raptors, but escape when the Tyrannosaurus suddenly appears and kills both raptors, ignoring the humans.

His eagerness to please others and penchant for testing his boundaries sometimes gets him into trouble.,"In the Pride Lands of Africa, a lion rules over the animals as king. The birth of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi's son Simba creates envy and resentment in Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, who knows his nephew now replaces him as heir to the throne. After Simba has grown into a young cub, Mufasa gives him a tour of the Pride Lands, teaching him the responsibilities of being a king and the circle of life. Later that day, Scar tricks Simba and his best friend Nala into exploring a forbidden elephant graveyard, despite the protests of Mufasa's hornbill majordomo Zazu. At the graveyard, three spotted hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai and Ed attack the cubs before Mufasa, alerted by Zazu, rescues them and forgives Simba for his actions. That night, the hyenas, who are allied with Scar, plot with him to kill Mufasa and Simba.\r\rThe next day Scar lures Simba to a gorge and tells him to wait there while he gets Mufasa. On Scar's orders, the hyenas stampede a large herd of wildebeest into the gorge. Mufasa rescues Simba, but as Mufasa tries to climb up the gorge's walls, Scar throws him back into the stampede, where he is trampled to death. After Simba finds Mufasa's body, Scar convinces him he was responsible for his father's death and advises Simba to flee the kingdom. As Simba leaves, Scar orders Shenzi, Banzai and Ed to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. That night, Scar announces to the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing a pack of hyenas to live in the Pride Lands.\r\rAfter running far away, Simba collapses from exhaustion in a desert. Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and a warthog, find him and nurse him back to health. Simba subsequently grows up with them in the jungle, living a carefree life with his friends under the motto ""hakuna matata"" (""no worries"" in Swahili). When he is a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reconcile and fall in love. Nala urges Simba to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a wasteland with not enough food and water. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off, leaving Nala disappointed and angry. As Simba exits the jungle, he encounters Mufasa's mandrill friend and advisor, Rafiki. Rafiki tells Simba that Mufasa is ""alive"" and takes him to a pond. There Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as the king of the Pride Lands. Simba realizes he can no longer run from his past and goes home. Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa join him, and agree to help him fight.\r\rAt the Pride Lands, Simba sees Scar hit Sarabi and confronts him, but Scar taunts Simba over his ""part"" in Mufasa's death. However, when Scar pushes Simba to the edge of Pride Rock, he reveals that he killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba roars back up and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs Simba for mercy, saying he is family and placing the blame on the hyenas. Simba says he does not believe Scar anymore but spares his life and commands him to forever leave the Pride Lands. Scar meekly walks past him, but then attacks his nephew. After a fierce fight, Simba throws his uncle off Pride Rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and eaten alive by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them.\r\rWith Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba ascends to the top of Pride Rock and takes over the kingdom as the rain falls again. Sometime later, with Pride Rock restored to its former glory, Simba looks down happily at his kingdom with Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa by his side; Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the inhabitants of the Pride Lands, and the ""circle of life"" continues.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMzgwNTUzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMxMzM3Ng@@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.121012526,,,,,G,1223,8.5,532273,6/24/94,0,"89,73",workprint version,89 min,0,0,0,The Lion King,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King,"Irene Mecchi (screenplay), Jonathan Roberts (screenplay), Linda Woolverton (screenplay), Burny Mattinson (story), Barry Johnson (story), Lorna Cook (story), Thom Enriquez (story), Andy Gaskill (story), Gary Trousdale (story), Jim Capobianco (story), Kevin Harkey (story), Jorgen Klubien (story), Chris Sanders (story), Tom Sito (story), Larry Leker (story), Joe Ranft (story), Rick Maki (story), Ed Gombert (story), Francis Glebas (story), Mark Kausler (story), J.T.

After persuading his friends and fellow performers, Bernadette Bassinger (Terence Stamp), a recently bereaved transsexual woman, and Adam Whitely (Guy Pearce), a flamboyant and obnoxious younger drag queen who goes under the drag name Felicia Jollygoodfellow, to join him, the three set out in a large tour bus, which Adam christens ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" for a four-week run in the Australian Outback town.\r\rWhile on the long journey through remote lands bordering the Simpson Desert, they meet a variety of characters, including a group of friendly Aboriginal Australians for whom they perform, the less accepting attitudes of rural Australia in such towns as Coober Pedy, and are subjected to homophobic abuse, violence, including having their tour bus vandalized with the words ""AIDS fuckers go home"".\r\rWhen the tour bus breaks down in the middle of the desert, Adam spends the whole day repainting it pink to cover up the vandalism. The trio later meet Bob, a middle-aged mechanic from a small outback town who joins them on their journey. Before they arrive at Alice Springs, Tick reveals that Marion is actually his wife, as they never divorced, and that they are actually going there as a favour to her. Continuing their journey, Adam is almost mutilated by a homophobic gang before he is saved by Bob and Bernadette. Adam is shaken and Bernadette comforts him, allowing them to reach an understanding. Likewise, the others come to terms with the secret of Tick's marriage and resolve their differences. Together, they fulfil a long-held dream of Adam's, which, in the original plan, is to climb Uluru in full drag regalia (""A cock in a frock on a rock""), although the location was changed to King's Canyon in the film (see below).\r\rUpon arrival at the hotel, it is revealed that Tick and Marion also have an eight-year-old son, Benjamin, whom Tick has not seen for many years. Tick is nervous about exposing his son to his drag profession and anxious about revealing his homosexuality, though he is surprised to discover that Benjamin already knows and is fully supportive of his father's sexuality and career. By the time their four-week stint at the resort is over, Tick and Adam head back to Sydney, taking Benjamin back with them, so that Tick can get to know his son and Marion can have a long-earned break.

He drives to an empty city. He wakes up again, this time to a woman in his bed. He tells her not to leave messages on his alarm.\r\rFrom a prison cell in Madrid, the 25-year-old man, Cí©sar (Eduardo Noriega), tells his story to psychiatrist Antonio (Chete Lera) while wearing a prosthetic mask. Flashbacks reveal the following events: good-looking Cí©sar is attractive to women. At his birthday party, he flirts with Sofí_a (Pení©lope Cruz), the girlfriend of his best friend Pelayo (Fele Martí_nez). Later on, he takes her home and stays the night, although they do not sleep together. The next morning, Cí©sar's obsessive ex-lover Nuria (Najwa Nimri) pulls up outside Sofí_a's flat, offering him a ride and sex. On the way to her home, however, she crashes the car with the intent to kill them both. Cí©sar is horribly disfigured, beyond the help of cosmetic surgery. Sofí_a cannot bear to see him like this and goes back to Pelayo.\r\rAfter Cí©sar's disfigurement, he begins to have a series of disorienting experiences. Drunk, Cí©sar falls asleep in the street. On awakening, everything has changed: Sofí_a now claims to love him and the surgeons restore his lost looks. But as he makes love to Sofí_a one night, she changes into Nuria. Horrified, Cí©sar smothers her with a pillow, yet finds everyone else believes Nuria was indeed the woman everyone else calls Sofí_a.\r\rWhile he is confined to the prison, fragments of his past return to him as if in a dream. It is revealed that, shortly after his disfigurement, Cí©sar contracted with Life Extension, a company specializing in cryonics, to be cryogenically preserved and to experience extremely lucid and lifelike virtual reality dreams. Returning to their headquarters, under supervision by prison officers, he discovers they specialise in cryonics with a twist: ""artificial perception"" or the provision of a fantasy based on the past to clients who are reborn in the future. He had committed suicide at home after sleeping drunk on the street, and was placed in cryonic suspension. His experiences from about the midpoint of the movie onward have been a dream, spliced retroactively into his actual life and replacing his true memories. At the end of the film he elects to wake up and be resurrected. Convinced his life since the drunken night in the street is simply a nightmarish vision created by Life Extension, Cí©sar leaps from the roof of the company's high-rise headquarters, and wakes to a female voice telling him to relax and open his eyes.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTk1NDU4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTIzNjQ5._V1_SX300.jpg,0.993052822,,,,,R,2311,7.8,48697,12/19/97,1,117,,117 min,0,0,0,Open Your Eyes,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Your_Eyes_(1997_film),"Alejandro Amen__bar, Mateo Gil",1997

Tomoko reveals that a week ago, she and three of her friends watched a weird tape and received a call after watching. Tomoko is killed by an unseen force as Masami watches, horrified.\r\rDays later, Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima), a reporter investigating the popularity of the video curse, discovers that her niece Tomoko, and her three other friends, mysteriously died at the same time, on the same night, with their faces twisted in fear. She also discovers that Masami became insane and is in a mental hospital. After stumbling upon Tomoko's photos from the past week, Reiko finds that the four teenagers stayed in a rental cabin in Izu.\r\rReiko goes to Izu and arrives at the rented cabin, where she finds an unlabeled tape in the reception room of the teenager's rental cottage. Watching the tape, Reiko sees a series of seemingly unrelated disturbing images. As soon as the tape is over, Reiko sees a mysterious reflection in the television and receives a phone call, with an unknown voice telling her ""seven days"". Disturbed, she leaves the cabin.\r\rReiko enlists the help of her ex-husband, Ry_ji Takayama (Hiroyuki Sanada). They take a picture of Reiko and find her face blurred in the photograph. Ry_ji then watches the tape, against Reiko's objections. A day later, Reiko creates a copy for Ry_ji for them to study. They find a hidden message embedded within the tape saying ""frolic in brine, goblins be thine"". The message is in a form of dialect from Izu _shima Island. That night, Reiko catches her young son Yoichi watching the videotape; claiming that Tomoko had told him to do it. Reiko and Ry_ji sail for _shima and discover the history of the great psychic Shizuko Yamamura, who was accused of faking supernatural powers; and thus committed suicide.\r\rWith only a day left, Reiko and Ry_ji discover that the videotape was made psionically by Shizuko's lost daughter, Sadako Yamamura, whose supernatural powers surpassed even those of her mother. The two go back to Izu with the assumption that Sadako is dead and her vengeful spirit (Onry_) killed the teenagers. They uncover a well underneath the cabin and through a vision see the circumstances of Sadako's murder by her father. They try to find Sadako's body in an attempt to appease her spirit. Minutes before her seven days are up, Reiko finds Sadako's corpse, and they believe that the curse is broken.\r\rThe next day Ry_ji is at home and his TV switches on by itself, showing the image of a well. The ghost of Sadako crawls out of the well, out of Ry_ji's TV set, and frightens him into a state of shock, killing him via cardiac arrest. Before dying, he manages to dial Reiko's number; she hears his last minutes over the phone and realizes the videotape's curse remains unbroken. Desperate to save her son, Reiko realizes that copying the tape and showing it to someone else saved her. With a VCR and Ry_ji's copy of the tape, Reiko travels with her son to see her father in an attempt to save him, realizing that this is a never-ending cycle: The tape must always be copied and passed on to ensure the survival of the viewers.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyMDEyMjY3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg3NDEzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.006353679,,,,,UNRATED,12211,7.3,46424,1/31/98,0,96,,96 min,0,0,0,Ringu,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(film),"Hiroshi Takahashi (screenplay), K_«ji Suzuki (novel)",1998

Andy decides to leave him behind, and his mother puts him on a shelf. The next day, Woody discovers that the penguin squeaky toy Wheezy has been shelved for months due to a broken squeaker. When Andy's mother puts Wheezy in a yard sale, Woody rescues him, only to be stolen by a greedy toy collector. Woody's friend Buzz Lightyear and all of Andy's other toys identify the thief from a commercial as Al McWhiggin, the owner of a toy store called Al's Toy Barn. Buzz, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Rex all set out to rescue Woody.\r\rAt Al's apartment, Woody learns that he is a valuable collectable based on a 1950s[7] TV show called Woody's Roundup and is set to be sold to a toy museum in Tokyo. The other toys from the showäóîJessie, Woody's horse Bullseye, and Stinky Peteäóîare excited about going, but Woody wants to return home because he is still Andy's toy. Jessie is upset because the museum is only interested in the collection if Woody is in it. Without him, they will be returned to storage. When Woody's arm is accidentally torn off, he attempts to retrieve it and escape but is foiled. The next morning, Woody's arm is repaired, and he learns that Jessie was once the beloved toy of a child named Emily, who eventually outgrew her and gave her away. Stinky Pete warns him that the same fate awaits him when Andy grows up, whereas he will last forever in the museum. This convinces Woody to stay, now believing that all toys eventually get discarded by their owners.\r\rMeanwhile, Buzz and the other toys reach Al's Toy Barn. While searching the store for Woody, Buzz is imprisoned in a cardboard box by another Buzz Lightyear action figure with a utility belt, who thinks that he is a real space ranger. The new Buzz joins the other toys, who mistake him as their Buzz and after discovering Al's plan, they make their way to his apartment. The real Buzz escapes from the box and pursues them, accidentally freeing a Zurg toy in the process, who immediately goes after Buzz, intent on destroying him. After the toys find Woody, the real Buzz rejoins them and proves that he is Andy's Buzz, but Woody refuses to return home. Buzz reminds Woody of ""a toy's true purpose"" and warns him that in the museum, he will never be played with by a child again. After seeing a boy play with him on the TV, Woody changes his mind and asks the Roundup toys to come with him, but Stinky Pete prevents their escape because he wants to go to Japan, as he was never sold to children.\r\rAl arrives and takes the Roundup toys with him, so Andy's toys follow him while the new Buzz chooses to remain behind with Zurg, who confronts them on the elevator and reveals himself to be Buzz's father. Accompanied by three toy Aliens, they steal a Pizza Planet delivery truck and follow Al to an airport, where they enter the baggage handling system and free Woody. Stinky Pete rips Woody's right arm again and tries to mutilate him with his pickaxe, but is stuffed into a little girl's Barbie backpack by Andy's toys to teach him a lesson of what it is like to be played with. They free Bullseye, but Jessie ends up on the plane bound for Japan. Assisted by Buzz and Bullseye, Woody frees Jessie and the toys find their way home.\r\rWhen Andy returns home from camp, he accepts Jessie, Bullseye, and the Aliens as his new toys, thinking his mother bought them, and repairs Woody's torn arm. The toys learn from a commercial that Al's business has suffered due to its failure to sell the Roundup toys. Woody tells Buzz that he is not worried about Andy discarding him because, when he does, they will still have each other for company. Meanwhile, Wheezy's squeaker has been fixed and performs a Frank Sinatra-style version of ""You've Got a Friend in Me"".",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0OTU0NTcyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk5Mjc4OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.181083467,,,,,G,2311,7.9,332784,11/24/99,0,"92,Turkey:82",TV version,92 min,0,0,0,Toy Story 2,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story_2,"John Lasseter (original story by), Pete Docter (original story by), Ash Brannon (original story by), Andrew Stanton (original story by), Andrew Stanton (screenplay), Rita Hsiao (screenplay), Doug Chamberlin (screenplay), Chris Webb (screenplay)",1999

Still, Benigno notices that Marco cries.\r\rMarco is a journalist and travel writer, who happens to see a TV interview with Lydia Gonzíçlez, a famous female matador. He thinks that an article on her would be interesting and, on the instructions of his editor, he contacts her in a bar, where she asks him to take her to her house. As they talk, she elaborates on the fact that she broke up with her boyfriend äóìel Nií±o de Valenciaäó, another matador, something that has been all over the tabloids. As Marco confesses that he knows nothing of bullfighting and that he is a journalist, she becomes angry and leaves his car without saying a word. As he drives off, he hears a scream inside her house and stops; Lydia rushes off and climbs back into his car: she asks him to kill a snake that she found in her house. He does so and comes out of the house crying. With that new confidence established between them, they become friends and, later on, lovers. Marco attends a wedding in Toledo and is surprised to find Lydia there too, since she had said that she did not want to go. The wedding turns out to be that of Marcoäó»s former fiancí©e, Angela, who had the same phobia of snakes as Lydia; Marco was very much in love with Angela and had a very hard time getting over her (which was the reason for his constant crying over things he could not share with her). Lydia says that she has something important to say, but she prefers to wait until after the bull-fight that afternoon; but she is gored and becomes comatose. Marco does not leave her side at the hospital and finally befriends Benigno, who recognizes him from the dance recital. Marco is told by the doctors that people in a coma never wake up and that, while there are miracle-stories of people who have come back, he should not keep his hopes high.\r\rBenigno is a personal nurse and caregiver for Alicia Roncero, a beautiful dance student, who lies in a coma, but Benigno sees her as alive; he talks his heart out to her, and brings her all kinds of dancing and silent black and white film mementos. As it turns out, Benigno had been obsessed with Alicia for a while, before she was in a coma, since his apartment is in front of the dance studio where she practiced every day. At first his obsession was only from a distance, since Benigno was taking care of his possessive mother, who seemed to be immobile. For that reason, he became a nurse and also a beautician. Free to move about after his mother dies, he finally picks up the courage to talk to Alicia, after she dropped her wallet on the street. As they walk together to her house, they talk about her discovery of silent black and white films and about dancing. When she walks into her building, Benigno notices that she lives in the houseof Dr Roncero, who is a psychiatrist. Benigno makes an appointment to see the doctor and talks about his unresolved bereavement grief over his mother. But it is all a ruse to gain access to the apartment, where he steals a hair-clip from Aliciaäó»s room. That night, Alicia is run over by a car and becomes comatose. By mere chance, Benigno is assigned to Alicia, much to the surprise of her father. But since Benignoäó»s services are the best, he hires him and a colleague permanently to tend for Alicia. Benigno also lies to Dr. Roncero that he is homosexual, so that Alicia's father won't suspect his love for her.\r\rBenigno keeps telling Marco that he should talk to Lydia because, despite the fact that they are in a coma, women understand and react to menäó»s problems. Eventually, Marco learns from el Nií±o de Valencia that Lydia and el Nií±o had decided to be together again, and that she intended to tell Marco. So Marco finds himself alone again. As he is about to leave, he comes into Aliciaäó»s room, looking for Benigno, but he instead finds himself opening his heart out to her, despite his scepticism over Benignoäó»s theories. Benigno and Marco leave the hospital and, in the parking lot, Benigno tells Marco of his plans to marry Alicia: Marco is taken aback, telling his friend that Alicia is basically dead and cannot express her will in any manner. But Benigno does not hear any reason. During a routine review at the hospital, the supervisors notice that Alicia has missed several periods; since this is a common occurrence with people in a coma, they do not think twice over it. However, Alicia is pregnant and an investigation ensues where Benigno is the main suspect.\r\rMarco has left Spain to write a book about travelling. Months later, in Jordan, he reads in a newspaper that Lydia has finally died, having never awakened from her coma. He phones the hospital, looking for Benigno, only to hear that Benigno does not work there any more. Marco manages to talk to another nurse whom he had befriended; she tells him that Benigno is now in prison for the alleged rape of Alicia. Marco returns to Spain and visits Benigno, who asks him to hire a new lawyer and find out what happened to Alicia. Marco stays in Benignoäó»s apartment and sees that Alicia has awakened during or after delivering a stillborn baby. Following the urging of Benigno's lawyer, Marco does not tell Benigno about Alicia's unexpected recovery. Desperate, Benigno writes a farewell letter to Marco and takes a large quantity of pills, to try to ""escape"" into a coma, thus reuniting with Alicia. He dies of an overdose.\r\rMeanwhile, Alicia has begun rehabilitation to recover her ability to walk and dance.

The chicken stops between the gang and a young man named Rocket (Buscapí©), who believes that the gang wants to kill him. A flashback traces Rocket, the narrator, back to the 1960s. He lived incredibly poor.\r\rThree impoverished, amateur thieves known as the ""Tender Trio"" äóñ Shaggy, Clipper, and Goose äóñ rob and loot business owners; Goose is Rocket's brother. The thieves split part of the loot with the citizens of the City, and are protected by them in return. Several younger boys idolize the trio and one, Li'l Dice (Dadinho), convinces them to hold up a motel and rob its occupants. The gang agrees, resolving not to kill anyone, and tell Li'l Dice to serve as lookout. They give him a gun and tell him to fire a warning shot if the police arrive but an unsatisfied Li'l Dice fires a warning shot mid-robbery and guns down the motel inhabitants once the gang have run off. The massacre brings the attention of the police, forcing the trio to split up: Clipper joins the church, Shaggy is shot by the police while trying to escape the favela, and Goose is shot by Li'l Dice after taking the thieving boy's money while his friend Benny (Bení©) watches.\r\rLater in the '70s, Rocket has joined a group of young hippies. He enjoys photography, and likes one girl, but his attempts to get close to her are ruined by a group of petty criminal kids known as ""The Runts"". Li'l Dice now calls himself ""Li'l Zí©"" (""Zí© Pequeno""), and along with Benny has established a drug empire by eliminating all of the competition, except for one dealer named Carrot, and forcing Carrot's manager Blackie (Neguinho) to work for him instead.\r\rA relative peace has come over the City of God under the reign of Li'l Zí©, who avoids police attention by having an initiate kill a Runt. Zí© plans to kill Carrot, but Benny talks him out of it.\r\rEventually, Benny and his girlfriend decide to leave the City, but during the farewell party Zí© is distracted, and Blackie accidentally kills Benny while trying to shoot Li'l Zí©. As Benny was the only man holding Zí© back from taking over Carrot's business, his death leaves Zí© unchecked and Carrot kills Blackie for endangering his life.\r\rFollowing Benny's death, Zí© beats up a peaceful man named Knockout Ned and rapes Ned's girlfriend. After Ned's brother stabs Zí©, his gang retaliates by killing his brother and firing on Ned's house and killing his uncle. Ned, looking for revenge, sides with Carrot and eventually a war breaks out between Carrot and Zí©.\r\rAs the '80's begin, both sides enlist more ""soldiers"", with Zí© providing weapons for the Runts and eventually the reason for the war is forgotten. One day, Zí© has Rocket take photos of him and his gang. After Rocket leaves his film with a friend who works at a newspaper, a female reporter publishes one of the prints, since nobody can get into the City of God anymore. Rocket takes a romantic interest in the reporter, eventually losing his virginity to her.\r\rRocket thinks his life is endangered but agrees to continue taking photographs, not realizing Zí© is very pleased with increased notoriety. Rocket then returns to the City for more photographs, bringing the film to its beginning. Confronted by the gang, Rocket is surprised that Zí© is asking him to take pictures, but as he prepares to take the photo after forgetting the chicken, the police arrive, who drive off when Carrot arrives. In the gunfight, Ned is killed by a boy who has infiltrated his gang to avenge his father, a security guard who was killed by Ned during a bank robbery. The police capture Li'l Zí© and Carrot, planning to give the media Carrot, whose gang never paid off the police, while they steal Zí©'s money and let him go. He is then murdered by the Runts who intend to run the criminal enterprise themselves. Rocket secretly takes pictures of both scenes, as well as Zí©'s dead body, and brings them back to the newspaper.\r\rRocket is seen in the newspaper office looking at all of his photographs through a magnifying glass, and deciding whether to publish the photo of corrupt cops and become famous or the photo of Li'l Zí©'s body and get an internship. He decides on the latter and the film ends with the Runts walking around the City of God, making a hit list of the dealers they plan to kill in order to take over the drug business. They mention that a Comando Vermelho (""Red Command"") is coming.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4ODQ3ODkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTc4NDI3._V1_SX300.jpg,0.551616692,,,,,R,232,8.7,467314,2/13/04,0,"130,Canada:135",Toronto International Film Festival,130 min,0,0,0,City of God,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_God_(2002_film),"Paulo Lins (novel), Br__ulio Mantovani (screenplay)",2002

Satan appears in Jesus' form, and tempts him by saying, ""It's not right for one man to die for their sins."" After Jesus' sweat becomes like blood and drips to the ground, a snake comes out from Satan. Jesus hears his disciples calling him, then he steps on the snake's head, and the Devil disappears. After receiving thirty pieces of silver, Judas, another of Jesus' disciples, approaches with the temple guards and betrays Jesus with a kiss on the cheek. As the guards move in to arrest Jesus, Peter cuts off the ear of Malchus, a servant of the high priest Caiaphas, but Jesus heals the ear. As the disciples flee, the temple guards arrest Jesus and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin. John tells Mary and Mary Magdalene of the arrest while Peter follows Jesus at a distance. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. When questioned by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus replies ""I am"". Caiaphas is horrified and tears his robes, and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter, who is secretly watching, is confronted three times and denies three times, but then runs away sobbing after remembering that Jesus had foretold that. Meanwhile, the remorseful Judas attempts to return the money to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by Demons, he flees the city and hangs himself upon a tree with a rope he finds on a dead donkey.\r\rCaiaphas brings Jesus before Pontius Pilate to be condemned to death, but after questioning Jesus and finding no fault in him, Pilate sends him instead to the court of Herod Antipas, as Jesus is from Herod Antipas' ruling town of Nazareth, Galilee. After Jesus is again found not guilty and returned, Pilate offers the crowd that he will chastise Jesus and then will set him free. He then attempts to have Jesus freed by giving the people an option of freeing Jesus or the violent criminal Barabbas. To his dismay, the crowd demands to have Barabbas freed and Jesus killed. In an attempt to appease the crowd, Pilate orders that he be punished, but not killed. Jesus is brutally scourged and mocked with a crown of thorns by his guards. However, Caiaphas, with the crowds backing, continues to demand that Jesus be crucified, and Barabbas released. Pilate washes his hands and reluctantly orders Jesus' crucifixion.\r\rAs Jesus carries the cross along the Via Dolorosa to Calvary, Veronica wipes Jesus' face with her veil. Simon of Cyrene is unwillingly pressed into carrying the cross with Jesus. Jesus is then crucified. As he hangs from the cross, Jesus prays forgiveness for those who did this to him and redeems a criminal crucified next to him. After Jesus gives up his spirit and dies, a single drop of rain falls from the sky, triggering an earthquake which destroys the Temple and rips the cloth covering the Holy of Holies in two, to the horror of Caiaphas and the other priests.

The older generation are still largely social-democrats and proponents of Quebec nationalism, but both political and economic developments after the äóìQuiet Revolutionäó of the 1960s, as well as their own aging, make their left-wing stance seem somewhat anachronistic.\r\rThe plot revolves around the character Rí©my's battle with terminal cancer, and the efforts of Sí©bastien, his estranged son to make his dying father more comfortable in his last days. Finally the father and son travel to Vermont in the United States to receive medical care.\r\rSí©bastien, at the request of Rí©my's ex-wife Louise, has reluctantly returned from London where he has a successful career in quantitative finance - anathema to his father's socialist persuasions. However, this background helps Sí©bastien to navigate and manipulate Quebec's healthcare system (portrayed as somewhat overloaded in the film) to secure better care for his father. In the process, he also gathers the various other friends and family members from Rí©my's past who come to visit and comfort him. During Rí©my's last days, he and his friends travel to the cottage of the first film, and discuss philosophy, politics, and past sexual and intellectual exploits.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyODI5OTM3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY5MzQyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.462907852,,,,,R,2211,7.7,23601,3/5/04,0,"99,Canada:112",DVD version,99 min,0,0,0,The Barbarian Invasions,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Barbarian_Invasions,Denys Arcand,2003

But it is only through the process of loss that they discover what they had to begin with.","The emotionally withdrawn Joel Barish and the unrestrained free-spirit Clementine Kruczynski begin a relationship on a Long Island Rail Road train from Montauk, New York. They are almost immediately drawn to each other despite their radically different personalities.\r\rAlthough they do not realize it at the time, Joel and Clementine are, in fact, former lovers, now separated after having spent two years together. After a fight, Clementine hires the New York City firm Lacuna, Inc. to erase all of her memories of their relationship. Upon discovering this, Joel is devastated and decides to undergo the procedure himself, a process that takes place while he sleeps.\r\rMuch of the film takes place in Joel's mind. As his memories are erased, he tries to evade the erasing effects of the procedure by hiding Clementine in remote parts of his unconscious. Joel finds himself revisiting them in reverse. Upon seeing happier times of love with Clementine from earlier in their relationship, he struggles to preserve at least some memory of her and his love for her. Despite his efforts, the memories are slowly erased, with the last memory of Clementine telling him, ""Meet me in Montauk.""\r\rIn separate but related story arcs occurring during Joel's memory erasure, the employees of Lacuna are revealed to be more than peripheral characters. Patrick, one of the Lacuna technicians performing the erasure, is dating Clementine while viewing Joel's memories, and copying aspects of their relationship in order to seduce her. Mary, the Lacuna receptionist, is dating the other memory-erasing technician, Stan. As it turns out, Mary had an affair with Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, the married doctor who heads the companyäóîa relationship which she agreed to have erased from her memory when it was discovered by his wife. Once Mary learns this, she quits her job, confronts Stan about his knowledge of her relationship with Howard (which he denies knowing about), steals the company's records, and sends them out to all the company's clients.\r\rJoel and Clementine come upon their Lacuna records shortly after re-encountering each other on the train. They react with shock and bewilderment, given that they have no clear memory of having known each other, let alone having had a relationship and having had their memories erased. Joel beckons Clementine to start over; Clementine initially resists, pointing out it could go the same way. Joel accepts this, and they decide to attempt a relationship anyway, starting their life together anew.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NzcwODg3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTEwOTMyMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.763912432,,,,,R,1222,8.4,577081,3/19/04,1,108,,108 min,0,0,0,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Sunshine_of_the_Spotless_Mind_(film),"Charlie Kaufman (story), Michel Gondry (story), Pierre Bismuth (story), Charlie Kaufman (screenplay)",2004

Before he can get it however, Yoon Tae-goo, The Weird (Song Kang-ho)äóîa thiefäóîsteals the map and is caught up in The Bad's derailment of the train. This involves the slaughter of the Japanese and Manchurian guards, and various civilians. Park Do-won, The Good (Jung Woo-sung)äóîan eagle-eyed bounty hunteräóîappears on the scene to claim the bounty on The Bad. Meanwhile The Weird escapes, eluding his Good and Bad pursuers. A fourth forceäóîa group of Manchurian banditsäóîalso want the map to sell to the Ghost Market. The Weird hopes to uncover the map's secrets and recover what he believes is gold and riches buried by the Qing Dynasty just before the collapse of their government. As the story continues, an escalating battle for the map occurs, with bounties placed on heads and the Imperial Japanese Army racing to reclaim its map as it can apparently ""save the Japanese Empire"".\r\rAfter a series of graphic shootouts and chases, a final battle erupts in which the Japanese army, Manchurian bandits, The Good, The Bad and his gang are chasing The Weird all at once. The Japanese army kills most of the bandits. The Good kills many Japanese soldiers and sets off an explosion that drives them away. The Bad's gang is slowly killed off and he kills those that attempt to leave the chase. Only the Bad, the Weird and the Good make it to the ""treasure"". However, they find that it is nothing more than a boarded-over hole in the desert. The Bad recognizes The Weird as the ""Finger Chopper""äóîa criminal that cut off his finger in a knife fight five years agoäóîand the man that the Good had thought the Bad to be. Turning on each other in a final act of vengeance for the slights they suffered, they finally gun each other down after a prolonged Mexican standoff. The three lie in the sand, dying and alone, as the ""useless hole"" that they fought and died for suddenly and belatedly erupts with a geyser of crude oil. The Good does survive along with the Weird. With a newly raised bounty on the Weird, a new chase begins as he flees across the Manchurian desert.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BYzgxYWM3MjEtZjhmYi00YWRlLWE4YjItYmI3NTVmOTljNzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.055641627,,,,,R,12210,7.3,23620,7/17/08,0,"South Korea:139,South Korea:120,Argentina:130,Japan:129,USA:130,Sweden:125,136",,130 min,0,0,0,"The Good, the Bad, the Weird",movie,0,0,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad,_the_Weird","Jee-woon Kim (screenplay), Min-suk Kim (screenplay)",2008

(see Kaun Banega Crorepati), and is one question away from the grand prize. However, before the _20 million (US$310,000) question, he is detained and tortured by the police, who suspect him of cheating because of the impossibility of a simple ""slumdog"" with very little education knowing all the answers. Jamal recounts, through flashbacks, the incidents in his life which provided him with each answer. These flashbacks tell the story of Jamal, his brother Salim (adult Madhur Mittal, adolescent Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, child Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail), and Latika (adult Freida Pinto, adolescent Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar, child Rubina Ali). In each flashback Jamal has a point to remember one person, or song, or different things that lead to the right answer of one of the questions. The row of questions does not correspond chronologically to Jamal's life, so the story switches between different periods (childhood, adolescence) of Jamal. Some questions do not refer to points of his life (cricket champion), but by witness he comes to the right answer.\r\rJamal's flashbacks begin with his managing, at age five, to obtain the autograph of Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan, which his brother then sells, followed immediately by the death of his mother during the Bombay Riots. As they flee the riot, they run into a child version of the god Rama. Salim and Jamal then meet Latika, another child from their slum. Salim is reluctant to take her in, but Jamal suggests that she could be the third musketeer, a character from the Alexandre Dumas novel (which they had been studying äóî albeit not very diligently äóî in school), whose name they do not know. The three are found by Maman (Ankur Vikal), a gangster who tricks and then trains street children into becoming beggars. Maman attempts to recruit Salim, but when Salim discovers Maman is blinding the children in order to make them more effective beggars, he flees with Jamal and Latika to a departing train. However, when Latika catches up to the train and takes Salim's hand, he purposely lets go, and she is recaptured by the gangsters. Over the next few years, Salim and Jamal make a living travelling on top of trains, selling goods, picking pockets, working as dish washers, and pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal, where they steal people's shoes. At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika, discovering that she has been raised by Maman to become a prostitute and that as a virgin she is expected to fetch a high price. The brothers rescue her, and Salim draws a gun and kills Maman. Salim then manages to get a job with Javed (Mahesh Manjrekar), Maman's rival crime lord. Back at their room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him and Latika alone. When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him, and Latika persuades him to go away to protect him.\r\rYears later, while working as a tea server at an Indian call centre, Jamal searches the centre's database for Salim and Latika. He fails in finding Latika but succeeds in finding Salim, who is now a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's organization, and they reunite. Jamal attacks Salim, who pleads for forgiveness, and lets him stay in his luxurious apartment. Jamal then bluffs his way into Javed's residence and reunites with Latika. While Jamal professes his love for her, Latika asks him to forget about her. Jamal promises to wait for her every day at 5 o'clock at the VT station. Latika attempts to rendezvous with him, but she is recaptured by Javed's men, led by Salim. Jamal loses contact with Latika when Javed moves to another house, outside Mumbai. Jamal becomes a contestant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, knowing that she watches the show regularly. He makes it to the final question, much to the consternation of the show's host, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor), and becomes a wonder across India. Kumar feeds Jamal the incorrect response to the penultimate question and, when Jamal chooses the correct answer instead, turns him in to the police on suspicion of cheating.\r\rBack in the interrogation room, the police inspector (Irrfan Khan) calls Jamal's explanation ""bizarrely plausible"" and allows him to return to the show. At Javed's safehouse, Latika sees Jamal on the news and Salim, in an effort to make amends for his past behaviour, gives Latika his mobile phone and car keys, and asks her to forgive him and to go to Jamal. Latika is reluctant out of fear of Javed, but agrees and escapes. Salim fills a bathtub with money and sits in it, waiting for Javed and his men. Jamal's final question is, by coincidence, the name of the third musketeer in The Three Musketeers, which he never learned. Jamal uses his Phone-A-Friend lifeline to call Salim's cell, as it is the only phone number he knows. Latika answers the phone, and, while she does not know the answer, tells Jamal that she is safe. Relieved, Jamal randomly picks Aramis, the right answer, and wins the grand prize. Simultaneously, Javed hears Latika on the show and realizes that Salim has betrayed him. He and his men break down the bathroom door, and Salim kills Javed before being gunned down by his men. With his dying breath, Salim gasps, ""God is great."" Later that night, Jamal and Latika meet at the railway station and kiss.

She lives on an East London council estate with her single mother, Joanne, and younger sister, Tyler, and is highly antagonistic toward both of them. Mia is a loner, appearing to have had a falling out with her best friend Keely. She provokes Keely's other friends and head butts another girl when Mia criticises their dance routine. Mia regularly practises hip-hop dance alone in a deserted flat.\r\rNear the estate, Mia comes across a skinny, tethered horse in a traveller encampment. She tries to free it, only to be caught, taunted, and assaulted by two young men, the horse's owners. A third young man, Billy, the brother of the other two, is more sympathetic. He shows kindness towards Mia and explains that the horse is old and ill.\r\rJoanne's new boyfriend, Conor O'Reily, is a charming and handsome Irishman. He drives them on a day-trip into the countryside, intent on making a good impression with the daughters. He introduces them to his favourite song, Bobby Womack's version of ""California Dreamin'"", shows Mia how to catch a fish using noodling, and asks her to show off her dance moves. Although Mia is abrupt with Conor, she appears to be intrigued by him.\r\rMia goes to a cybercafe and watches amateur breakdancing videos on YouTube. Just as Mia is about to leave, she finds a flyer for a club seeking dancers and at the door, Keely's friends enter and they exchange taunts. Mia visits Conor at work, as a security guard at a hardware store along with Billy, and they sneak into a junkyard for auto engine parts. Conor encourages Mia to apply for the dancing audition. He lends her a video camera to record an audition tape. Their interactions continue to be flirtatious. After giving Mia the camera, Conor puts on cologne and leans into Mia while asking what she thinks of it before suddenly administering a spanking for running off when a social worker visited. One night Mia secretly witnesses Conor and Joanne having sex. Mia then goes back to her room and slams the door several times. Mia sends in her tape and is invited by the club to perform in person. Late one night, with Joanne passed out drunk upstairs, and after Mia and Conor have both been drinking, he asks to see her dance routine in the living room. When she dances to ""California Dreamin'"", Conor then invites her to sit next to him which leads to them having sex. Before returning to Joanne's bedroom, Conor tells Mia to keep their liaison a secret.\r\rThe following morning, Mia hears her mother crying, Tyler tells her that Conor has left. Mia tracks him down to his home in Chadwell St Mary and confronts him. He explains that he cannot see Mia any more because of her age. He drives her to Tilbury Town railway station and provides her fare. Instead, Mia comes back and sneaks in through the house's back window. Finding a video camera and watching it, she then discovers Conor's wife and young daughter, Keira. Mia then urinates on the living room floor and sneaks out of the back door upon the return of Conor's family.\r\rWatching Keira riding her scooter on the house's road, Mia impulsively pressures Keira to go with her under the claim that Keira's mother told Mia to take her for ice cream. Going out into the fields and reaching the River Thames, Keira tries to escape. Mia catches up with her, but in the struggle, Mia throws Keira into the turbulent river water, disappearing and resurfacing after a moment then Mia pulls her out, and takes her home as night falls. When walking along a street, Conor's car screeches to a halt beside her. Mia leads Conor on a chase, when he catches up with her, he slaps her, knocking her to the ground, and then walks away without saying a word.\r\rThe next day, Mia goes to her audition. It is immediately obvious that it is for erotic dancers. The other participants are all grown women wearing heavy makeup and provocative clothing. Mia takes the stage wearing a hoodie, but as the music starts, she walks off before performing her routine.\r\rMia goes in search of Billy. When she arrives at his place, Billy tells her that the horse had to be put down. Mia sinks to the ground in tears. Billy says he is moving to Cardiff, Wales, and invites her to join him.\r\rMia returns home to pack, dances with Joanne and Tyler, and goes to Billy's car after hugging Tyler goodbye. The two set off for Wales.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NTk4MzkxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDkxMDAxMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.06876745,,,,,NOT RATED,12210,7.3,42876,9/11/09,0,123,,123 min,0,0,0,Fish Tank,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_Tank_(film),Andrea Arnold,2009

Herzog received special permission from the French Minister of Culture to film inside the cave.[6] Having received permission, Herzog nonetheless had to film under heavy restrictions. All people authorized to enter must wear special suits and shoes that have had no contact with the exterior.[7] Also, because of near-toxic levels of radon and carbon dioxide, nobody can stay in the cave for more than a few hours per day.[2]\r\rHerzog was allowed to have only three people with him in the cave: the cinematographer Peter Zeitlinger, a sound recorder (Eric Spitzer-Marlyn), and an assistant. Herzog himself worked the lights.[6] The crew was allowed to use only battery-powered[2] equipment they could carry into the cave themselves,[6] and only lights that gave off no excess heat.[1] The 3-D cameras were custom-built for the production, and were often assembled inside the cave itself.[6] Herzog was allowed six shooting days of four hours each.[6] The crew could not touch any part of the cave's wall or floor, and were confined to a 2-foot-wide (0.61 m) walkway.[6]\r\rThe production encountered several technical difficulties in working with the 3-D cameras in a documentary setting. At the time of production, 3-D films were typically shot on stages with heavy use of digital manipulation. Often, foreground and background elements would be shot separately and digitally composited into the finished shot. Techniques for 3-D filmmaking in natural environments with a single camera and no compositing were largely undeveloped, and had to be worked out experimentally by the crew in post-production.[8]\r\rBefore production of Cave of Forgotten Dreams, Herzog was skeptical of the artistic value of 3-D filmmaking, and had only seen one 3-D film (James Cameron's Avatar). Herzog still believes that 3-D is not suited for general use in cinema, but used it in Cave to help ""capture the intentions of the painters"", who incorporated the wall's subtle bulges and contours into their art.[6] The idea to use a 3-D camera for the film was first suggested by Zeitlinger, who had imagined before ever entering the cave that 3-D might be appropriate to capture the contours of the walls. Herzog dismissed the idea, believing 3-D to be (in Zeitlinger's words) ""a gimmick of the commercial cinema"". After visiting the cave, however, Herzog immediately decided that the film must be shot in 3-D.[8] After the production, Herzog stated that he had no plans to use 3-D again.[",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNDExMzUwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM2MzYwNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,0.069780007,,,,,G,12210,7.4,9663,8/31/11,0,"Canada:95,90",,90 min,0,0,0,Cave of Forgotten Dreams,movie,0,0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_Forgotten_Dreams,Werner Herzog,2010

Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger, who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerstrí_m, Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik's grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago. After moving to the Vanger family's compound, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing a list of names and numbers that no one has been able to decipher.\r\rSalander, who is under state legal guardianship due to diagnosed mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman, after her previous guardian has a stroke. Bjurman abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and then rapes her, not realizing she has a hidden video camera in her bag. At their next meeting she stuns him with a Taser, rapes him with a dildo and marks him as a rapist with a tattoo on his chest and stomach. Using her video recording she threatens blackmail, insisting that he write a glowing progress report and allow her full control of her money.\r\rBlomkvist's daughter visits him and notes that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger's lawyer, Dirch Frode, that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander based on the work she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook's content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik's brother Harald identifies Martin, Harriet's brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, as a possible suspect. Salander's research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.\r\rBlomkvist breaks into Martin's house to look for more clues, but Martin catches him and prepares to kill him. While torturing Blomkvist, Martin brags of having killed women for decades, but denies killing Harriet. Salander arrives, subdues Martin and saves Blomkvist. While Salander tends to Blomkvist, Martin flees. Salander, on her motorcycle, pursues Martin in his SUV. He loses control of his vehicle on an icy road and dies when it catches fire. Salander nurses Blomkvist back to health, and tells him that she tried to kill her father when she was 12. Blomkvist deduces that Harriet is still alive and her cousin Anita likely knows where she is. He and Salander monitor Anita, waiting for her to contact Harriet. When nothing happens, Blomkvist confronts her, deducing that Anita is Harriet herself. She explains that her father and brother had sexually abused her for years, and that Martin saw her kill their father in self-defense. Her cousin Anita smuggled her out of the island and let her live under her identity. Finally free of her brother, she returns to Sweden and tearfully reunites with Henrik.\r\rAs promised, Henrik gives Blomkvist the information on Wennerstrí_m, but it proves worthless. Salander hacks into Wennerstrí_m's computer and presents Blomkvist with evidence of Wennerstrí_m's crimes. Blomkvist publishes an article that ruins Wennerstrí_m, who flees the country. Salander hacks into Wennerstrí_m's bank accounts and, travelling to Switzerland in disguise, transfers two billion euros to various accounts. Wennerstrí_m is found murdered. Salander reveals to her former guardian that she is in love with Blomkvist.
